  abstract: |-
    <kbsml_text>
    <p>The purpose of these studies is to determine patterns of microbial biomass dynamics in crop and successional communities.</p>
    <p>
    This project consists of two studies involving microbial biomass determination in soil samples taken from the main cropping system study (KBS004). These studies are: Chloroform Fumigation-Incubation: Soil Microbial Biomass C and N, and Epifluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis: Soil Microbial Biovolume and C. The data for both studies are generated from subsets of the same soil samples, collected from treatments 1 - 8, CF, DF, and SF. See the descriptor (KBS004) for treatment descriptions. Samples are collected approximately monthly (during ice-free conditions) or annually (varies by year) from 5 sampling stations in each of 6 replicate plots per treatment; exceptions are treatment 8 (four reps), and treatments CF, DF, and SF (three reps each). For experiment descriptions, protocols, and data, see individual datasets.</p>
    <p>
    Samples were collected by K. Klingensmith in 1989 and by S. Halstead in other years.  D. Harris performed lab analysis, data entry, data analysis, and data submission.  Original data files not available; contact the LTER data manager with questions.  The data currently available was derived from web-based files which were last reviewed by D. Harris on 10-01-1997 and may be available from archives.

    The distribution and composition of the weed seed bank in treatments 1-7 of the main cropping system experiment (see KBS004) is periodically evaluated to determine 
    # how well the seed bank predicts weed abundances and composition in subsequent years, and 
    # how changes in disturbance (tillage) and plant species (cropping systems) affect the bank.  Composite soil samples to two depths are periodically elutriated to determine seed densities, species composition, and viabilities of seven target species which are dominant on the site.

  abstract: |-
    Results from a study of spatial variability conducted across the main experimental area (45 ha) at KBS prior to dividing the site into 1-ha experimental plots.  During the 1988 growing season a stratified unaligned sampling scheme was used to collect 400--600 samples across the site (uniformly planted to a single variety of soybeans) for:
    # geomorphological characteristics (microtopography, soil horizon depths, bulk density, texture); 
    # soil chemical characteristics (pH, NO3, NH4, total C, total N, moisture, inorganic P, trace metals); 
    # soil biological characteristics (N mineralization potentials, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass N, fungal/bacterial ratios, nematodes and other soil invertebrates;  seed bank size); 
    #  plant weed species abundance, weed biomass at peak standing crop); and    
    # insect characteristics (major pest and predator species).  
    
    Most soil samples were taken before crop emergence, plant phenology samples were taken throughout the growing  season, biomass samples were taken at physiological maturity, and insect samples were taken continuously.  Dried soil and plant samples are archived for potential future analysis.

  abstract: |-
    Results from a study of N2O and CO2 fluxes from soybean/corn
    
    cropping systems either no-till (NT) or conventionally tilled (CT; moldboard
    
    plow) and either N-fertilized (180 kg/ha N) or not N-fertilized in a complete
    
    factorial design with four replicate blocks (2 x 2 x 4 treatment plots) plus
    
    the never-tilled early successional sites (n = 4 replicates) noted in KBS004.
    
    Fluxes are measured using static chambers 30 cm x 30 cm x 14 cm high placed on
    
    semipermanent bases installed in the surface soil of each plot. Gas samples are
    
    taken from each plot at 15-minute intervals for 90 minutes per sample day, once
    
    per week or keyed to rainfall events.

  title: Main Cropping System Experiment
  abstract: |-
    <p>Most long-term hypotheses associated with the KBS LTER site are being tested within the context of the main cropping systems study. This study was established on a 48 ha area on which a series of 7 different cropping systems were established in spring 1988, each replicated in one of 6 ha blocks. An eighth never-tilled successional treatment, is located 200 m off-site, replicated as four 0.06 ha plots. 
     </p> 
     <p>
    Cropping systems include the following treatments: 
      <ol> 
       <li>standard chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation conventionally tilled (corn/soybean prior to 1992) </li> 
       <li>standard chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation no-tilled (corn/soybean prior to 1992) </li> 
       <li>low chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation conventionally tilled (ridge till prior to 1994) </li> 
       <li>zero chemical input corn/soybean wheat rotation conventionally tilled (ridge till prior to 1994) </li> 
       <li>Populus clones on short-rotation (6-7 year) harvest cycle </li> 
       <li>continuous alfalfa, replanted every 6-7 years </li> 
       <li>early successional community on historically tilled soil </li> 
       <li>successional community on never-tilled soil. </li> 
      </ol> 
     </p>
     <p>
    For specific crops in a given year see the Annual Crops Summary Table.
    </p> 
    <p>
    In 1993 a series of forest sites were added to the main cropping system study to provide long-term reference points and to allow hypotheses related to substrate diversity to be tested. These include: 
     <ul> 
      <li>DF - three deciduous forest stands, two old-growth and one 40-60 years post-cutting </li> 
      <li>CF - three conifer plantations, 40-60 years old </li> 
      <li>SF - three old-field (mid-successional) sites 40+ years post-abandonment. </li> 
      </ul>
     </p> 
     <p>
    All share a soil series with the main cropping system treatments, and are within 5 km of all other sites. 
     </p> 
     <p>
    For each system (and for a number of microplot treatments nested within the main treatment plots) the following baseline variates are being measured (described in greater detail in other data set descriptors): 
      <ul> 
       <li>plant characteristics, including species distributions and abundances, net aboveground productivity by functional group (crop vs. non dominant biomass, selected non dominant biomass), economic yields, tissue C and N contents, seed bank composition; </li> 
       <li>soil chemical and physical characteristics, including soil moisture, pH, inorganic N and P pools, total C, N, and P pools, bulk density; </li> 
       <li>soil biological characteristics, including microbial biomass C and N, N mineralization rates (buried bags), microbial populations, invertebrate populations; and </li> 
       <li>insect and pathogen dynamics, including distributions and abundances of major insect pests and predators and of Fusarium pathogens. </li> 
      </ul>

  abstract: |
    Originally, wind direction and speed, total solar radiation, net solar radiation, rainfall, air temperature, and relative humidity were recorded hourly in connection with measurements of evapotranspiration and deep percolation from a 6 m2 in-ground weighing lysimeter.  The lysimeter and fetch area were planted to continuous alfalfa.  
    
    Although the lysimeter is no longer in operation, weather data collection continues.  Precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge until fall of 1997, when it was replaced with a weighing bucket rain gauge.  All other sensors are electronic, connected to a data logger that is polled remotely.  Instruments to measure wind speed and direction are mounted on a tower at 10 m.  Light sensors (net solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation) a thermometer, and an RH probe (with a built-in thermometer) are mounted at about 3 m.  Soil moisture and temperature is being monitored on a trial basis near the base of the tower.  4-16-2002 T.T.B.

  title: Living Field Laboratory
  abstract: |
    <p>The Living Field Laboratory is a long-term rotation study established in 1993 under the direction of Emeritus Professor Dr. Richard Harwood to evaluate the benefits of cover crops (as green manure) and/or the addition of composted dairy manure in two integrated systems compared to a conventional and an organic system. The LFL accommodates every entry point of the crop rotation each year and has a factorial design that allows for the comparison of a number of interactions. These interactions include: differences in N management, rotation effects, and cover crops. From 1993 through 2005, the rotation consisted of corn (Zea mays L.)/corn/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum) vs. continuous corn. During this period, crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) was seeded to 1st yr. corn, 2nd yr corn was in rye grass (Lolium multiflorum), soybean had no cover, and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) was frost-seeded into wheat.</p>
    
    <p>In 2006, under the direction of Dr. Sieglinde Snapp and through consultation with a farmer advisory group, the rotation was shortened to a 3 yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat vs. continuous corn. The remaining plot in each management system was converted to a 2 yr rotation of corn/soybean. Cereal rye (Secale cereale) is now planted after corn regardless of crop rotation. Cereal rye follows soybean in the 2-yr rotation. Red clover is frost-seeded into wheat.</p>
    
    <p>The management systems are: Conventional, Integrated Fertilizer and Integrated Compost. Weed management is identical across systems, and nitrogen fertilizer management adjusted to take into account soil N availability and balance nitrogen inputs across treatments. The cover crop is present as a split plot (plus minus) within each system. The split-plot cover crop treatment was established in 1993 in Integrated Fertilizer and in Integrated Compost, while the split-plot cover crop treatment was established 14 years later in 2007 in the Conventional treatment, to allow a comparison of short and long-term cover crop presence.</p>
    
    <p>In 2007, the organic management system was changed to a comparison of a perennial grain systems (perennial wheat-alfalfa intercrop) and a 4-yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat/ alfalfa (Medicago sativa). This allows the comparison of a typical Michigan field crop organic system to a novel system that involves a new, perennial system.</p>
