    Social
    Dimensions of Soil Carbon Dynamics
  abstract: |-
    Our research goal was to gain an understanding of
    the social and economic factors that contribute to the spatial and
    temporal variation in the soil carbon dynamics of agricultural
    ecosystems in the U.S. Midwest. Our working hypothesis was that
    soil carbon dynamics are affected by 1) social and economic
    structure and 2) agronomic management (see figure one).Through visual surveys, and mail and telephone
    surveys, the row crop operators in the four townships surrounding
    the KBS LTER were identified. Preliminary data on social and
    economic structure and agronomic management was collected from the
    row crop operators.Our first hypothesis was that growers use
    relatively simple management heuristics for making agronomic
    decisions. The data collected did not uphold this hypothesis. The
    management heuristic for each farm varied in its level of
    complexity, as well as in its form. This made the process of
    grouping farms by similar inputs, tillage systems and cropping
    sequences impossible and matching farms to the different treatment
    protocols at the LTER problematic.Our second hypothesis was that farmers manage all
    of their acreage using the same management regime or heuristic. Our
    results found this to not be so. The farmers managed their acreage
    using different heuristics for different fields at the same time.
    The heuristics included: 1) biophysical factors such as the
    differing slopes, soil textures and orientations of different
    fields; 2) organizational factors such as institutional pressures
    and rewards; 3) cultural factors such as personal beliefs and
    values; 4) population factors such as migration patterns and
    changes in population densities around the individual fields; and
    5) technological factors such as the types of machinery, seed,
    fertilizers, and pesticides available for use, and the time,
    knowledge and economic resources necessary to utilize a
    technology.Our third hypothesis was that farmers manage a
    field following a consistent management scheme over time. Even this
    was shown not to be consistent. Individual fields were managed
    differently over time for a variety of reasons. These reasons were
    sorted into five categories. The first category is biophysical
    factors such as annual variation in the climate (temperature,
    precipitation), and the type and pressure of weeds the past season.
    The second category includes demographic changes such as aging,
    health, and family structural changes such as the birth or death of
    a family member or divorce. The third category, organizational
    changes, includes changes such as new markets, changes in land
    tenure, and/or incorporation of the farm operation. The fourth
    category, changing cultural pressures, includes educational
    changes. The last category, technological changes, includes changes
    in crop needs.On the basis of these results, we are gathering
    information that will allow us to further understand the factors
    that are influencing the operators' attitudes and behavior, and to
    build a model of the farm operators&#8217; decision-making
    process.

  title: 
  abstract: "The biochemical pathway and genetics of autotrophic ammonia oxidation have been studied almost exclusively in Nitrosomonas europaea. Terrestrial autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOs), however, comprise two distinct phylogenetic groups in the beta-Proteobacteria, the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups. Hybridization patterns were used to assess the potential of functional probes in non-PCR-based molecular analysis of natural AAO populations and their activity. The objective of this study was to obtain an overview of functional gene homologies by hybridizing probes derived from N. europaea gene sequences ranging in size from 0.45 to 4.5 kb, and labeled with 32P to Southern blots containing genomic DNA from four Nitrosospira representatives. Probes were specific for genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase (amoA and amoB), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao), and cytochrome c-554 (hcy). These probes produced hybridization signals, at low stringency (30&deg;C), with DNA from each of the four representatives; signals at higher stringency (42&deg;C) were greatly reduced or absent. The hybridization signals at low stringency ranged from 20 to 76% of the total signal obtained with N. europaea DNA. These results indicate that all four functional genes in the ammonia oxidation pathway have diverged between the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups. The hao probe produced the most consistent hybridization intensities among the Nitrosospira representatives, suggesting that hao sequences would provide the best probes for non-PCR-based molecular analysis of terrestrial AAOs. Since N. europaea can also denitrify, an additional objective was to hybridize genomic DNA from AAOs with probes for Pseudomonas genes involved in denitrification. These probes were specific for genes encoding heme-type dissimilatory nitrite reductase (dNir), Cu-type dNir, and nitrous oxide reductase (nosz). No hybridization signals were observed from probes for the heme-type dNir or nosz, but Nitrosospira sp. NpAV and Nitrosolobus sp. 24-C hybridized, under low-stringency conditions, with the Cu-type dNir probe. These results indicate that AAOs may also differ in their mechanisms and capacities for denitrification. "

  title: 
  abstract: "No-till management has been shown to increase soil aggregation, reduce erosion rates, and increase soil organic matter across a range of soil types, cropping systems, and climates. Few agricultural practices provide similar opportunities to deliver positive benefits for farmers, society, and the environment. The potential benefits of no-till are not being fully realized, however, in large part because no-till is rarely practiced continuously and many fields suitable for no-till are still conventionally tilled. We present here three arguments, based on recent research, in support of the agronomic and environmental benefits of continuous no-till: (i) although there exist agronomic challenges with no-till, long-term yields in these systems can equal or exceed those in tilled soils; (ii) cultivating no-till systems can decrease soil aggregation and accelerate C and N losses so rapidly that years of soil restoration can be undone within weeks to months; and (iii) over time, changes in soil structure and organic matter, coupled with producer adaptation to the need for spatially and temporally explicit chemical applications, increase plant N availability and reduce environmental N losses. At least in theory, then, continuous no-till can be widely practiced to improve the environment and maintain yields with little or no economic sacrifice by producers. In practice, however, many diverse challenges still limit no-till adoption in different regions. These challenges are surmountable, but potential solutions need to be interdisciplinary and address the ecological and especially the social and economic constraints to deploying continuous no-till."

  title: 
  abstract: "Field CO2 production was related to soil carbon pools and fluxes determined by laboratory incubation of soils from agroecosystems designed to test the possibility of substituting biological for chemical inputs. Treatments included: conventional and organic-based row crops, woody and herbaceous perennial crops and historically tilled and never tilled successional fields. The CO2 efflux in corn and soybeans was affected by crop residues from previous years and growing season temperatures but not soil moisture. Overwinter cover crops and perennials such as alfalfa and poplar, resulted in fairly uniform fluxes of approximately 20 kg CO2-C ha(-1) day(-1) throughout the non-frozen period. Highest fluxes occurred in alfalfa, historically tilled successional and never tilled, grassland successional treatments, although, highest aboveground productivity occurred in the corn and poplar. Summed, field CO2 fluxes were similar to residue-C inputs. Measurement of CO2 mineralized in extended incubations in the laboratory made it possible to use soil enzyme activity to determine the size and dynamics of soil C pools. The residue of acid hydrolysis defined the size of the resistant pool C-r. Carbon dating determined its mean residence time (MRT). Curve analyses of CO2 evolution plotted on a per unit time basis gave the active (C-a) and slow (C-s) pool sizes and decomposition rate constants k(a) and k(s). Temperature correction factors provided field MRTs. The active pool of this coarse textured soil represents 2% of the soil C with a MRT of 30-66 days. The slow pool represents 40-45% of the SOC with field MRTs of 9-13 years. The poplar soil has the greatest MRT for both the active and slow pools. The system approach to land use sustainability (SALUS) model, which predicts CO2 evolution from decomposition in the field as part of a plant growth - soil process model, was tested using the decomposition parameters determined by incubation and C-14 dating. The model satisfactorily predicted the intra and inter year differences in field CO2 but over predicted fluxes from residues in the fall. It does not yet adequately consider a lag period during which the residues lose their hydrophobicity, are comminuted and colonized. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. "

    Nitrogen
    Leaching and Retention Under Alfalfa and Bare Fallow at the LTER
    Root Turnover Site
  abstract: |-
    Contributions of a legume crop to
    the soil nitrogen dynamics were evaluated at the LTER root turnover
    site which compared soluble soil nitrogen pools among treatments of
    bare soil in the presence and absence of alfalfa roots and shoots
    in a Kalamazoo loam soil (mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Spring
    spray-killing of the alfalfa generated 310 kg N ha-1 in
    the 0-120 cm soil profile during the 8-month period from April 29
    to December 17, 1997, Table 1. After three years without plant
    growth, mineralization of SOM in the bare soils produced 170 kg N
    ha-1 during the same 8-month period of time. Therefore,
    decomposition of a two-year alfalfa crop produced 140 kg N
    ha-1 during the subsequent 1997 growing season. The best
    cover crop management system for transferring this excessive soil
    nitrogen to subsequent cash crops is currently being studied in a
    rye-cover crop and Roundup-Ready corn management system.Table 1. Total mineral N content

  abstract: "Within the last several years, molecular techniques have uncovered numerous 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences which represent a unique and globally distributed lineage of the kingdom Crenarchaeota that is phylogenetically distinct from currently characterized crenarchaeotal species. rDNA sequences of members of this novel crenarchaeotal group have been recovered from low- to moderate-temperature environments (1.5 to 32&deg;C), in contrast to the high-temperature environments (temperature, &gt;80&deg;C) required for growth of the currently recognized crenarchaeotal species. We determined the diversity and abundance of the nonthermophilic members of the Crenarchaeota in soil samples taken from cultivated and uncultivated fields located at the Kellogg Biological Station's Long-Term Ecological Research site (Hickory Corners, Mich.). Clones were generated from 16S rDNA that was amplified by using broad-specificity archaeal PCR primers. Twelve crenarchaeotal sequences were identified, and the phylogenetic relationships between these sequences and previously described crenarchaeotal 16S rDNA sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analyses included nonthermophilic crenarchaeotal sequences found in public databases and revealed that the nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota group is composed of at least four distinct phylogenetic clusters. A 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for all known nonthermophilic crenarchaeotal sequences was designed and used to determine their abundance in soil samples. The nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota accounted for as much as 1.42% &plusmn; 0.42% of the 16S rRNA in the soils analyzed. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Information on the mean residence time (MRT) of soil organic carbon (SOC) on different soil types and management regimes is required for pedo-geological, agronomic, ecological and global change interpretations. This is best determined by carbon dating the total soil together with acid hydrolysis and carbon dating of the non-hydrolyzable residue (NHC). Midwestern US soils in a transect from Lamberton. MN to Kutztown. PA were found to contain from 33% to 65% of their SOC in the non-hydrolyzable fraction. Soils on lacustrine deposits had the most NHC; glacial till and shale soils, the least. The MRTs of the SOC of surface horizons of soil ranged from modem to 1100 years with an average of 560 years. The MRT increased to an average of 1700 years in the 25-50-cm depth increment and 2757 years at 50-100 cm. The NHC was 1340 years greater at the surface and 5584 years at depth. The MRTs of the total SOC were inversely correlated to sand and directly related to clay content. Silt did not have a significant effect on the MRT of total SOC, but was significantly correlated with the MRT of the NHC. A four-parameter model described the relationship between the SOC content and MRT. The complexity of this equation reflected the strong effect of depth, which greatly decreased SOC while increasing the MRT. The MRT of these soils, as determined with carbon dating of the naturally occurring C-14, was compared to that measured with the C-13 signal produced by approximately 30 years of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (C-4) on soils with a known plant history of C-3-C-4 cropping. The equation of C-14 MRT = 176((CMRT)-C-13)(0.54) with an R-2 of 0.70 showed that although short-term C-13 studies correlate well with the total MRT, they reflect the dynamics of the active and slow pools, not the total SOC.

    Chemical Weathering Rates and Landscape Development:
    The Role of Hydrology, Climate, Vegetation, and Anthropogenic
    Activities
  abstract: |-
    Weathering is the physical and chemical breakdown
    of rocks. Chemical weathering involves the dissolution, alteration,
    and replacement of minerals unstable at the Earth&rsquo;s surface
    and/or precipitation of new minerals that are stable. The products
    of chemical weathering (e.g., soils and solutes) and processes
    (CO2 cycling) are important to the ecology of systems
    and to issues of global climate change. Although it is well known
    that the rates of chemical weathering are a function of the
    chemistry of the parent material, climate (temperature and
    precipitation), biological activity, and hydrology, there are still
    many questions as to how all of these factors interrelate to
    control weathering rates.The objective of this long-term research is to
    investigate the roles of hydrology, climate, vegetation, and
    anthropogenic activity on chemical weathering rates via intersite
    LTER comparisons. The research is directed toward answering two
    questions: 1) what drives chemical weathering and 2) what are the
    links of chemical weathering to the ecosystem? The objectives are
    to: 1) initiate intersite comparisons that eventually include all
    LTER sites with surface and groundwater chemical fluxes, 2) utilize
    hydrologic and chemical data to calculate weathering rates, 3) test
    paradigms of weathering controls (T, P, etc.), and 4) link
    weathering to feedback mechanisms and ecology.To facilitate this research, an LTER-sponsored
    workshop was recently held with representatives from Luquillo,
    Konza, KBS, McMurdo, and North Temperate Lakes LTER sites. A
    position paper was developed to be given to the LTER PIs along with
    a questionnaire about each LTER site. Results from the
    questionnaire will be used to complete a data matrix started at the
    workshop on characterizing all LTERs. The data completed matrix
    will summarize the data available from and data needs of the
    various LTERs. A proposal will be submitted to NCEAS for
    workshop(s) to bring researchers from LTERs together to discuss
    weathering issues. Weathering rates will be developed for those
    sites that have already collected necessary data.A proposal for intersite work will be generated
    from these activities. The proposed research would provide for
    analysis of additional chemical parameters, including
    SiO2, as needed to develop complete chemical profiles at
    each site. An important aspect of this research is that it will
    provide a template for LTERs to collect a coordinated set of
    biogeochemical measurements that can be used for future intersite
    LTER comparisons.

  abstract: "The structure of microbial communities was examined as a function of community composition and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups to examine the effects that plant community composition and land-use history have on microbial communities in the soil. The sites sampled were part of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project in agricultural ecology at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State University (Hickory Corners, MI) and included both active and abandoned agricultural fields as well as nearby fields that had never been cultivated. Microbial community structure was assessed by extracting total RNA from soil samples and using 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to quantify the abundance of rRNA from the alpha, beta, and gamma Proteobacteria, the Actinobacteria (Gram positive bacteria with a high mol % G+C genome), the Bacteria, and the Eukarya. In addition, soil microbial communities were characterized by examining fluorescently tagged terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) in PCR amplified 16S rDNA. Microbial community structure was observed to be remarkably similar among plots that shared a long-term history of agricultural management despite differences in plant community composition and land management that have been maintained on the plots in recent years. In contrast, microbial community structure differed significantly between fields that had never been cultivated and those having a long-term history of cultivation. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Interpretation of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics depends heavily on analytical methods and management systems studied. Comparison of data from long-term corn (Zea mays)-plot soils in Eastern North America showed mean residence times (MRTs) of SOC determined by C-14 dating were 176 times those measured with C-13 abundance following a 30-yr replacement Of C-3 by C-4 plants on the same soils. However, MRTs of the two methods were related (r(2) = 0.71). Field C-13 MRTs of SOC were also related (R-2 = 0.55 to 0.85) to those measured by (CO2)-C-13 evolution and curve fitting during laboratory incubation. The strong relations, but different MRTs, were interpreted to mean that the three methods sampled different parts of a SOC continuum. The SOC of all parts of this continuum must be affected by the same controls on SOC dynamics for this to occur. Methods for site selection, plant biomass, soil sampling and analysis were tested on agricultural, afforested-agriculture, and native forest sites to determine the controls on SOC dynamics. Soil-C changes after afforestation were -0.07 to 0.55 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) on deciduous sites and -0.85 to 0.58 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under conifers. Soil N changes under afforestation ranged from -0.1 to 0.025 Mg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Ecosystem N accumulation was -0.09 to 0.08 Mg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Soil C and N sequestration but not plant biomass were related to soil Ca, Mg, and K contents. Comparative, independent assays of long-term plots provides information for concept testing and the confidence necessary for decision-makers determining C-cycle policies. "

    Field Crop Pest Ecology and Management: A Multimedia Extension
    Training Manual and Education Program
  abstract: |-
    Non-chemical pest management involves many
    techniques and skillsthat require a greater knowledge of field crop
    system ecology than is generally provided in farmer and agriculture
    professional training. In response to this need, we have initiated
    the production of a user-friendly, full-color, multimedia Extension
    training manual tentatively titled Michigan Field Crop Pest Ecology
    and Management. Crop pests will be addressed from a whole farm
    perspective with a focus on designing agricultural ecosystems that
    prevent pest problems by depending heavily on inherent ecosystem
    regulation of pest outbreaks. Seven Michigan State University
    research and Extension specialists in weed, insect, disease, and
    nematode ecology and management are currently writing the bulletin
    following a process that emphasizes integration of these different
    disciplines. KBS LTER research results will be included where
    appropriate. A synthesis chapter, co-written by all authors and
    produced during a two day retreat, will be the capstone of the
    publication. Three farmers, one Extension agent, and one Extension
    specialist will provide important "ground-truthing" of the
    publication. The impact of the proposed document is intended to be
    long-term and will become evident in subsequent training sessions
    in which we will use a co-learning model to train farmers and
    agriculture professionals.

  abstract: "Soils contain a large proportion of the carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere, yet the role of soils as a sink or a source of net atmospheric C flux is uncertain. In agricultural systems, soil C is highly influenced by management practices and there is considerable interest in adapting management systems to promote soil C sequestration, thereby helping to mitigate atmospheric CO2 increases. Long-term field experimental sites represent a unique source of information on soil C dynamics, and networks of such sites provide a key ingredient for making large-scale assessments of soil C change across ranges in climate and soil conditions and management regimes. Currently, there are collaborative efforts to develop such site networks in Australia, Europe, and North America.  A network of long-term experiments in North America was established to provide baseline information on the effects of management (i.e. tillage, crop rotations, fertilisation, organic amendments) on soil organic matter. Historical data on soils, primary productivity, climate, and management were synthesised by scientists from the individual field sites, representing a total of 35 long-term field experiments. An additional cross-site soil sampling campaign was carried out to provide uniform comparisons of soil C and nitrogen (N), both within and across sites. Long-term field experiments are a principle component necessary for regional assessments of soil C dynamics. We describe a general methodology for combining long-term data with process-oriented simulation models and regional-level, spatially resolved databases. Such analyses are needed to assess past and present changes in soil C at regional to global scales and to make projections of the potential impacts of changes in climate, CO2, and landuse patterns on soil C in agroecosystems.

    Root
    Recolonization of Previous Root Channels in Corn and Alfalfa
    Rotations
  abstract: |-
    Distribution of root systems in
    the soil profile is an important factor in the determination of
    water and nutrients available to plants. A minirhizotron (MR) study
    was conducted at the Agroecosystem Interactions site of the LTER on
    corn and alfalfa root systems throughout the soil profile of
    Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) monolith
    lysimeters for a three-year succession of corn, alfalfa and corn.
    Multiple-date comparisons within and between years were conducted
    to estimate total root densities in each soil horizon. Root
    recolonization was assessed by comparing every video frame of
    paired minirhizotrons, from recordings conducted on successive
    growing seasons.In 1994, root populations of corn
    in the Bt1 horizon peaked 75 to 90 days after planting
    (DAP). Numbers of corn roots per m2 in the
    Bt1 horizon were consistently higher for no-tillage (NT)
    than for conventional tillage (CT) lysimeters, in 1994 and 1996.
    Distribution of alfalfa roots within the soil profile was not
    significantly modified by tillage. However, alfalfa root
    decomposition rates responded to tillage practices and were
    specific to each soil horizon. Corn root systems growing in soils
    previously cropped with alfalfa presented similar patterns of root
    distribution by horizons as that of the previous alfalfa crop.
    Successive corn root systems did not display similar distribution
    patterns throughout the soil profile from one growing season to the
    next. Proportions of roots of the current crop recolonizing root
    induced macropores (RIMs) of the previous crop averaged 18% for
    corn after corn, 22% for alfalfa after corn and 41% for corn after
    alfalfa, across Bt horizons and tillage treatments (Table 1). In
    conclusion, distribution of the corn root system appeared modified
    by tillage practices and by the root system distribution of the
    preceding crop.Table 1.

  abstract: "To study the effects of organic matter and fertilizer additions on soil organic-matter (SOM) dynamics, we analyzed results from a 30-yr-old Swedish field experiment, using the CENTURY model. Field treatments on a sandy clay loam included bannual addition (up to 4000 kg C ha-1) of straw, sawdust, and no organic additions, with and without N fertilizer (80 kg N ha-1), and green manure, farmyard manure, and bare fallow. Soil C and N, crop production (small-grain and root crops), N uptake, and mineralization and immobilization of N were modeled and compared with field measurements. Changes in soil C and N, as much as 30% after 30 yr, were generally well represented by the model. Most of the treatment differences in SOM could be explained by the rate of organic-matter input, its lignin content, and C/N ratio, plus the effect of N fertilizer on belowground C inputs. However, there appeared to be additional positive effects of N supply on SOM accumulation that were not fully explained by the model. The quality of organic amendments strongly influenced N uptake and crop productivity, through controls on N mineralization and immobilization. Mean annual N uptake ranged from a low of 3.1 g m-2 in sawdust-amended soil to a high of 9.2 g m-2 in fertilized, straw-amended soil. Simulated N losses accounted for 7 to 20% of total N inputs. Nitrogen-balance estimates by the model were consistent with the observed data for four of the treatments, but treatments with low N availability appeared to have additional, unexplained N inputs. "

  abstract: "Disturbances typically associated with the study of soil microbial communities, i.e., sieving, storage, and subsequent incubation at elevated temperatures, were investigated with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Treatment effects were quantified by statistical analyses of the mole percentage distribution of the individual fatty acids. Changes in the concentrations of individual fatty acids over a 7-week storage period at 4.5 degrees C were generally not statistically significant. Sieving effects (mesh size, 4 or 2 mm) on CO2 evolution and the PLFA profile were monitored over 3 weeks; the physical disturbance had only minor effects, although some damage to fungal hyphae by the first sieving (&lt;4 mm) was suggested by a decrease in the signature fatty acid 18:2 omega 6c. Temperature effects were investigated by incubating soil for up to 3 weeks at 4.5, 10, or 25 degrees C. Principal component analyses demonstrated a significant shift in the PLFA composition at 25 degrees C over the first 2 weeks, while changes at the other two temperatures were minor. Several of the changes observed at 25 degrees C could be explained with reference to mechanisms of temperature adaptation or as a response to conditions of stress, including a decrease in the degree of unsaturation, an increased production of cyclopropyl fatty acids, and increased ratios of the branched-chain fatty acids iso-15:0 and iso-17:0 over anteiso-15:0 and anteiso-17:0, respectively. A decrease in the total amount of PLFA was also indicated. "

    Annual
    Variation of Corn Root System Distribution Within Kalamazoo Loam
    Soil Profiles.
  abstract: |-
    Distribution of corn root systems
    throughout Kalamazoo loam soils were recorded by minirhizotron
    technology at the Agroecosystem Interactions (AI) site from 1986 to
    1997. Forty five degree-angle minirhizotrons were installed under
    corn in 1986, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 96, and 97. Horizontal
    minirhizotrons were installed in four large monolith lysimeters at
    the AI site in 1990 and recorded for every subsequent growing
    season. This very large data set is currently being analyzed for
    growing season variability and tillage effects. Early results
    suggest that for most growing seasons no-tillage induced greater
    corn root populations (Fig. 1).
    Nevertheless, tillage effects differed among growing seasons. For
    some growing seasons, such as 1986, conventional tillage induced
    significantly greater root populations than no-tillage for some
    soil layers (Fig. 1).This project is aimed at
    determining the environmental factors that control root
    proliferation at given depths in response to tillage management.
    Corn water stress and soil water content per horizon is being
    modeled for the12 year-period at KBS with CERES-Maize (Fig. 2). In addition, modifications of
    soil water content by tillage managements are being simulated using
    the SALUS model, as explained in part III of this abstract.
    Possible interactions between simulated soil water content and root
    numbers for given sets of soil depth, growing season and tillage
    management will be analyzed.

  abstract: "Anaerobic microbial processes play particularly important roles in the biogeochemical functions of wetlands, affecting water quality, nutrient transport, and greenhouse gas fluxes. This study simultaneously examined nitrate and sulfate removal rates in sediments of five southwestern Michigan wetlands varying in their predominant water sources from ground water to precipitation. Rates were estimated using in situ push-pull experiments, in which 500 mL of anoxic local ground water containing ambient nitrate and sulfate and amended with bromide was injected into the near-surface sediments and subsequently withdrawn over time. All wetlands rapidly depleted nitrate added at ambient ground water concentrations within 5 to 20 h, with the rate dependent on concentration. Sulfate, which was variably present in porewaters, was also removed from injected ground water in all wetlands, but only after nitrate was depleted. The sulfate removal rate in ground water-fed wetlands was independent of concentration, in contrast to rates in precipitation-fed wetlands. Sulfate production was observed in some sites during the period of nitrate removal, suggesting that the added nitrate either stimulated sulfur oxidation, possibly by bacteria that can utilize nitrate as an oxidant, or inhibited sulfate reduction by stimulating denitrification. All wetland sediments examined were consistently capable of removing nitrate and sulfate at concentrations found in ground water and precipitation inputs, over short time and space scales. These results demonstrate how a remarkably small area of wetland sediment can strongly influence water quality, such as in the cases of narrow riparian zones or small isolated wetlands, which may be excluded from legal protection.

  abstract: "We sampled corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations, corn monocultures, and plant successional experiments in Southwest MI over a 2-year period to study the effects of alternative management practices on microbial biomass and particulate organic matter (POM) C and N in the top 20 or 25 cm of soil. Microbial biomass was measured using the chloroform fumigation, incubation method. POM was defined as the organic C and N content of primary soil particles in the 53-2000 mum size class. Microbial C decreased during a drought in 1994, and was greater in treatments receiving compost rather than inorganic fertilizer in 1995, but was only weakly correlated with N mineralization in aerobic laboratory incubations. Microbial biomass accounted for an average of 2.6% of soil C and 4.9% of soil N in all treatments sampled in 1995. Microbial C:N ratio was lower in July and November (6.0) than in April and September (7.3), and lower in successional treatments without tillage (5.2) than in agronomic treatments (6.7). Changes in microbial N were large enough to affect short term N availability, but tended to be transitory. POM increased after compost additions, and was greater in successional plots without tillage than in tilled treatments, but did not increase immediately after the incorporation of plant residues. POM accounted for 19.7% of C and 14.8% of N in 1995. Its C:N ratio was 20.8 in a never tilled successional treatment and 16.0 in all other soils. The C:N ratio was 17.0 on average in the 250-2000 mum size fraction, compared to 15.5 in the 53-250 mum fraction. There was a strong correlation between POM and N mineralization in 70- and 150-day aerobic incubations, but there was greater N mineralization per unit POM in April and November than in September or October in both years of the study. These results suggest that POM could be used to estimate N mineralization if combined with information about recently deposited plant residues. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. "

  abstract: "A simple, rapid method for bacterial lysis and direct extraction of DNA from soils with minimal shearing was developed to address the risk of chimera formation from small template DNA during subsequent PCR, The method was based on lysis with a high-salt extraction buffer (1.5 M NaCl) and extended heating (2 to 3 h) of the soil suspension in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and proteinase K. The extraction method required 6 h and was tested on eight soils differing in organic carbon, clay content, and pH, including ones from which DNA extraction is difficult, The DNA fragment size in crude extracts from all soils was &gt;23 kb. Preliminary trials indicated that DNA recovery from two soils seeded with gram-negative bacteria was 92 to 99%. When the method was tested on all eight unseeded soils, microscopic examination of indigenous bacteria in soil pellets before and after extraction showed variable cell lysis efficiency (26 to 92%). Crude DNA yields from the eight soils ranged from 2.5 to 26.9 mu g of DNA g(-1), and these were positively correlated with the organic carbon content in the soil (r = 0.73), DNA yields from gram-positive bacteria from pure cultures were two to six times higher when the high-salt-SDS-heat method was combined with mortar-and-pestle grinding and freeze-thawing, and most DNA recovered was of high molecular weight, Four methods for purifying crude DNA were also evaluated for percent recovery, fragment size, speed, enzyme restriction, PCR amplification, and DNA-DNA hybridization. In general, all methods produced DNA pure enough for PCR amplification, Since soil type and microbial community characteristics will influence DNA recovery, this study provides guidance for choosing appropriate extraction and purification methods on the basis of experimental goals.

There are two main reasons to consider spatial models in population dynamics: (1) improved estimation of the parameters by utilizing spatial replications, and (2) ecologically realistic modeling. In this paper, we suggest models that are generalizations of the univariate population dynamics models (for example, Ricker or Gompertz) to space-time situations. We accommodate both spatially correlated environmental perturbations and dispersal. Moreover, we suggest computationally simple parameter estimation procedures based on estimating functions and provide an approach for obtaining approximate confidence intervals. The methodology is illustrated on the spatial time series of gypsy moths in the lower peninsula of Michigan. "

  title: 
  abstract: "There is much interest in biogeochemical processes that occur at the interface between soils and streams since, at the scale of landscapes, these habitats may function as control points for fluxes of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Here we examine whether a thermodynamic perspective can enhance our mechanistic and predictive understanding of the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces, by considering how microbial communities interact with variations in supplies of electron donors and accepters. Over a two-year period we analyzed &gt;1400 individual samples of subsurface waters from networks of sample wells in riparian wetlands along Smith Creek, a first-order stream draining a mixed forested-agricultural landscape in southwestern Michigan, USA. We focused on areas where soil water and ground water emerged into the stream, and where we could characterize subsurface flow paths by measures of hydraulic head and/or by in situ additions of hydrologic tracers. We found strong support for the idea that the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces is a predictable outcome of the interaction between microbial communities and supplies of electron donors and accepters. Variations in key electron donors and accepters (NO3-, N2O, NH4+, SO42-, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) closely followed predictions from thermodynamic theory. Transformations of N and other elements resulted from the response of microbial communities to two dominant hydrologic flow paths: (1) horizontal flow of shallow subsurface waters with high levels of electron donors (i.e., DOG, CH4, and NH4+), and (2) near-stream vertical upwelling of deep subsurface waters with high levels of energetically favorable electron accepters (i.e., NO3-, N2O, and SO42-). Our results support the popular notion that soil-stream interfaces can possess strong potential for removing dissolved N by denitrification. Yet in contrast to prevailing ideas, we found that denitrification did not consume all NO3- that reached the soil-stream interface via subsurface flow paths. Analyses of subsurface N chemistry and natural abundances of delta(15)N in NO3- and NH4+ suggested a narrow near-stream region as functionally the most important location for NO3- consumption by denitrification. This region was characterized by high throughput of terrestrially derived water, by accumulation of dissolved NO3- and N2O, and by low levels of DOG. Field experiments supported our hypothesis that the sustained ability for removal of dissolved NO3- and N2O should be limited by supplies of oxidizable carbon via shallow flowpaths. In situ additions of acetate, succinate, and propionate induced rates of NO3- removal (similar to 1.8 g N.m(-2).d(-1)) that were orders of magnitude greater than typically reported from riparian habitats. We propose that the immediate near-stream region may be especially important for determining the landscape-level function of many riparian wetlands, Management efforts to optimize the removal of NO3- by denitrification ought to consider promoting natural inputs of oxidizable carbon to this near-stream region.

There was a slight significant correlation (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.005) between the number of roots measured by minirhizotron and root lengths measured by the LI method, however, no correlation was found with the CIP method. Using a single regression line, root number WaS underestimated by the minirhizotron method at depths between 0-7.6 cm. A correlation was found between root length estimated by LI and CIP. The slope of estimated RLD was significant with depth for these two methods. Root length density (RLD) measured by CIP showed a more erratic decline with distance from the plant row and soil surface than the LI method. "

  abstract: Root system changes in response to experimental treatments may he due to a number of factors, which can be separated only by sampling roots of known age. Minirhizotrons allow for video recording of the growth of individual roots; subsequent removal of the minirhizotron would allow sampling of the roots under observation. A design for a removable minirhizotron with mechanically expandable walls is described in this paper, along with the use of laparascopic tools for sampling roofs from removable minirhizotron systems. Laparascopic tools used in conjunction with removable minirhizotrons may be useful in field studies of the effects of root age and experimental treatments on root composition, physiology, and pathology; rhizosphere mycrobial ecology; rhizosphere mineralogy; and the dynamics of mycorrhizal colonization.

  abstract: "The influence of weed seed predation by invertebrates and vertebrates was examined in relation to distance from hedgerows in maize fields of southwestern Michigan. Experiments were conducted in spring and winter and included five common weed species, i.e., velvet-leaf (Abutilon theophrasti), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), common lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum), and yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens). In the spring post-tillage study, treatments excluding invertebrates, vertebrates, invertebrates + vertebrates plus no exclusion controls were established at 5 and 100 m from the hedgerow, Seeds were placed into the field in trays filled with sterilized soil at low densities to avoid creating a 'super stimulus' for seed predators. The trays were placed in the field for 3-4 weeks and then placed in a heated greenhouse and seed loss was estimated from the number of seedlings that emerged. The design of the winter study was similar except that only control and vertebrate exclusion treatments were used and seeds were left in the field from December to mid-April. Significant differences among exclusion treatments were found in spring in terms of seed loss. Seed loss was lowest in the treatments that excluded both vertebrates + invertebrates and highest under no exclusion, There was some evidence of preferential predation by vertebrates upon seeds of A. retroflexus and C. album. In winter, significant seed predation by vertebrates on all species except A. retroflexus were detected. In both seasons, seed predation was highly patchy among and within fields and there was no consistent effect of distance from hedgerow. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) contributes 430 million kg N year(-1) to the US Corn-Belt soils, according to a 1991 survey. Minimizing leaching losses from these very large N inputs requires a better understanding of the specific root dynamics that relate to the shoot-borne nitrates which have been reported to develop throughout many soil profiles. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of decaying alfalfa roots on nitrate inputs to soils and on soil hydraulic conductivity properties which affect nitrate leaching.  An experiment was initiated in 1994 and data for this report were taken from research on a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) at the KBS/LTER (long-term ecological research) site in southwestern Michigan, during the period from 1996 through 1997. Soil extractable nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) were monitored to soil depths of 150 cm and soil soluble NO3-N and NH4-N were monitored by suction lysimeters to the depth of 65 cm. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of soil was measured by the double-ring infiltrometer method. Following glyphosate termination of the alfalfa stands, nitrate-N released from mineralized alfalfa roots plus shoots totaled 75 kg ha(-1). Alfalfa roots generated 36 kg ha(-1) and alfalfa shoots generated 39 kg ha(-1) which accumulated in the Ap horizons from April to July in 1997. The presence of decaying alfalfa roots in the profile quadrupled Ksat values as compared to bare fallow soils. Nitrates released from decomposing alfalfa roots combined with root-enhanced hydraulic conductivities dramatically increased NO3-N leaching following the termination of alfalfa stands. NO3-N leaching to deeper horizons approached 83 kg ha(-1) in root treatments and 144 kg ha(-1) in the root plus shoot treatments during the period from April to December, following alfalfa termination. Our data suggest that under temperate climate such as that of Michigan, groundwater contamination by nitrates can be reduced by terminating alfalfa stands immediately before spring-planting of the subsequent row crop, which can absorb the large quantities of N leaking from decomposing shoots and roots of the legume.

  abstract: "The influence of tree density (2 x 3, 1 x 2, and 0.5 x 1 m) and weed control (weedy vs. weed free) on the growth and branching architecture of Populus Xeuramericana cv. Eugenei was examined in an experimental plantation in southwestern Michigan, U.S.A. In the presence of weeds, poplars were shorter (p &lt; 0.0001), had a smaller basal diameter (p &lt; 0.0001), initiated fewer branches (p = 0.0004), and had fewer living branches (p = 0.002), shorter branches (p &lt; 0.0001), and branches that spread outward (p &lt; 0.0001). Increasing tree density decreased poplar height (p &lt; 0.0001), basal diameter (p &lt; 0.0001), branch length (p = 0.0062), and the number of living branches (p &lt; 0.0001). At high densities, branches spread outward at their origin (p = 0.0015) and then curved sharply upward (p = 0.002). At the highest planting density there was no difference in branching in plots with and without weed control. However, poplars in the weedy treatment were smaller than those in the weed-free treatment (p &lt; 0.0001). Our results demonstrate that poplar growth and architecture can be influenced by competitors of very different stature. Weeds, in fact, have a greater effect on growth than conspecifics. As a result, poplars grown in the presence of weeds are stunted relative to poplars grown in the absence of weeds, even at the highest tree density where the competitive effects of poplars reduced weed biomass.

  abstract: "Autotrophic ammonia oxidizer (AAO) populations in soils from native, tilled, and successional treatments at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research site in southwestern Michigan were compared to assess effects of disturbance on these bacteria. N fertilization effects on AAO populations were also evaluated with soils from fertilized microplots within the successional treatments. Population structures were characterized by PCR amplification of microbial community DNA with group-specific 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) primers, cloning of PCR products and clone hybridizations with group-specific probes, phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rDNA sequences, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Population sizes were estimated by using most-probable-number (MPN) media containing varied concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Tilled soils contained higher numbers than did native soils of culturable AAOs that were less sensitive to different ammonium concentrations in MPN media. Compared to sequences from native soils, partial 16S rDNA sequences from tilled soils were less diverse and grouped exclusively within Nitrosospira cluster 3. Native soils yielded sequences representing three different AAO clusters. Probes for Nitrosospira cluster 3 hybridized with DGGE blots from tilled and fertilized successional soils but not with blots from native or unfertilized successional soils. Hybridization results thus suggested a positive association between the Nitrosospira cluster 3 subgroup and soils amended with inorganic N. DGGE patterns for soils sampled from replicated plots of each treatment were nearly identical for tilled and native soils in both sampling years, indicating spatial and temporal reproducibility based on treatment.

  abstract: "The armyworm (Pseudaletia unipuncta) was used as a model host insect to explore the influence of agricultural landscape structure at two spatial scales on larval parasitoid species richness and rates of larval parasitism in southern Michigan. First, within fields, we compared parasitoid communities in maize fields near, and distant from, a hedgerow edge. Second, we replicated these studies within a complex landscape (agricultural fields of small size embedded in a landscape with abundant hedgerows and woodlots) vs. a simple landscape (agricultural fields of large size embedded in a landscape with few hedgerows and woodlots).  The structural differences between the simple and complex agricultural landscapes were characterized by analysis of aerial photographs and digital land-use data. After landscape analysis, three maize fields from each area were selected for the experimental studies. The complex landscape contained fields that were 75% smaller, had 63% more perimeter of wooded field edge per hectare of field area, and had 81% more field edge in wide hedgerow than fields in the simple landscape. Fields in the simple landscape had 74% and 53% more field edge in herbaceous roadside and crop-to-crop interfaces, respectively, than did fields in the complex landscape. In the six selected maize fields, third and fifth instar P. unipuncta were released individually onto maize plants 5 m and 90 m from a hedgerow edge. Larvae were recovered after 4-5 d and reared in the laboratory to record parasitoid emergence. Parasitoid species diversity was similar in both landscape types (simple landscape: four species; complex landscape: five species). Mean percentage parasitism was significantly higher in the complex landscape than in the simple landscape(13.1% vs. 2.4%) but was not affected by the location within fields (near hedgerows vs. distant from hedgerows) in either landscape type.

  title: 
  abstract: "The current soil water component of the CROPGRO-Soybean model was structured for deep, well-drained soils. It did not have mechanisms for restricting root growth and root water uptake in soil layers with high mechanical impedance or soil layers with non-uniform root distribution. In this research, the model was modified to consider root growth and root water uptake under those conditions. Experimental data sets from Castana, Iowa, find Gainesville, Florida, with two contrasting soils were used for model validation. An empirical soil impedance factor was incorporated to influence the ability of roots to grow and proliferate in a layer: A root hospitality or clumping factor was incorporated to limit root water uptake in soil layers where roots are not uniformly distributed. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effects of these two factors and rate of root depth increase on root growth, soil wafer extraction, seed yield, and crop biomass. Root growth and soil factors were adjusted so that simulated soil water extraction from each soil layer correctly matched observed data. A maximum rate of vertical root growth was estimated to be 4.0 cm d(-1) for both locations. Root distribution with depth, soil water extraction pattern, and simulated crop responses were highly sensitive to this parameter In both soils, the root hospitality factor was 1.0 (implying uniform root distribution) from the soil surface to layers near the bottom of the root zone below which roots extracted water at lower rates. Both soils required a soil impedance factor at 30 to 45 cm of 0.2 or less to match the apparent vertical rate of root growth, root length distribution with depth, and observed soil water extraction patterns.  After confirming that the model accurately simulated soil water extraction patterns in both locations, the model predicted aboveground growth and yield very well at both locations. In the Castana experiment predicted seed yield was 3127 kg ha(-1) and mean measured seed yield was 2644 kg ha(-1). In Gainesville final seed yield predicted by the model was 1299 kg ha(-1) and measured seed yield was 1178 kg ha(-1). This research confirms the importance of root growth and root proliferation on soil water extraction, crop growth and yield, and it demonstrates the need for additional research to develop relationships between soil properties that are routinely measured and relatively simple root growth and distribution characteristics.

  abstract: "When appraising the impact of food and fiber production systems on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the 'greenhouse' effect, the entire suite of biogenic greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) - needs to be considered. Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system. Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40-44% of the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16-33% of GWP in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) y(-1). Carbon accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for &gt; 10 years while the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion to NT. "

  abstract: "We measured denitrification and total nitrate uptake rates in a small stream (East Fork of Walker Branch in eastern Tennessee) using a new field N-15 tracer addition and modeling approach that quantifies these rates for entire stream reaches. The field experiment consisted of an 8-h addition of 99 atom% (KNO3)-N-15 and a conservative solute tracer. Two 15N tracer addition experiments were performed on consecutive days, the first under ambient NO concentrations (23 mug N L-1) and the second with a NO3- addition of approximately 500 mug N L-1. We fit first-order NO3- uptake and two-box denitrification models to the longitudinal measurements of tracer N-15 in dissolved NO3-, N-2, and N2O in stream water to determine rates. Total NO; uptake rates were 0.028 m(-1) (0.32 mug N m(-2) s(-1)) and 0.01 m(-1) (1.6 mug N m(-2) s(-1)) under ambient NO3- and with NO3- addition, respectively. Denitrification rates were 0.0046 m(-1) (uncertainty range of 0.002 to 0.008 m(-1)) and 9 x 10(-5) m(-1) (uncertainty range of 3 x 10(-5) to 21 x 10(-5) m(-1)) under ambient NO3- and with NO3- addition, respectively. Denitrification resulted almost exclusively in N-2 production (&gt;99%) and comprised about 16% (+/-10%) of total NO3- uptake rate under ambient NO3- concentrations and about 1% (+/-1%) of total NO3- uptake rate with NO3- addition. Denitrification rate expressed on a mass flux basis was about 12 mumol m(-2) h(-1) under ambient NO3- concentrations, a value within the range reported for other streams with low NO3- concentrations.

  abstract: "The concentration and delta(15)N of NO3- in leachate from two undisturbed and unfertilized soil lysimeters, one conventionally tilled and one with no tillage, was determined on a bi-weekly basis from March through November, 1993 to assess the origins and transformations of NO3- leaching from an agricultural soil. Concentrations of NO3- in leachate from the tilled lysimeter were approximately twice those from the non-tilled lysimeter throughout the year and are consistent with observations that tilling favors the mineralization process in soils. Although no difference in delta(15)N between lysimeters was evident, NO3- from both lysimeters exhibited considerable isotopic variability, ranging from -3.9 parts per thousand in March to a late summer maximum of 9.6 parts per thousand. Low delta(15)N values in the spring and fall were indicative of NO3- derived from soil organic matter and affected by fractionation during mineralization. High values in late summer indicated NO3- originating from soils that had been influenced to a small extent by fractionation during denitrification. Weighted mean delta(15)N values for NO3- from the conventionally tilled and non-tilled lysimeters were 1.7 and 3.2 parts per thousand, respectively, and are depleted in N-15 by greater than 4 parts per thousand relative to soil organic matter. These delta(15)N values would normally be indicative of NO3- derived from fertilizers, however, in this study they reflect an origin from soil organic matter and are depleted in N-15 in response to fractionation during mineralization. The wide range of delta(15)N values in this study illustrates that sampling of NO3- in soil leachate at one point in time is clearly not sufficient to assess origins or identify the predominant microbial processes occurring in soils. Our results indicate that NO3- in soil leachate is subject to considerable isotopic variation and that delta(15)N may provide more information on the predominance of microbial processes in soils than on origins.

  abstract: "Papilio canadensis encounters shorter, cooler summers in interior Alaska than in northern Michigan: average thermal sums are 583 vs. 985 Celsius degree-days (10&deg;C base); mean daily temperature is 14.4 vs. 18.8&deg;. The temperature physiology of P. canadensis could be evolutionarily conserved, or the species may be a composite of regionally adapted populations. We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing the developmental physiology of P. canadensis from Alaska and Michigan across a range of temperatures in the laboratory and field. Higher temperatures generally resulted in more rapid larval development, but the effects varied with insect population and host. At low temperatures (12&deg;), Alaskan larvae grew faster than Michigan larvae (fifth instars doubled their fresh mass in 5.8 vs. 9.1 d), primarily due to 40% higher consumption rates. At high temperatures (30&deg;), Alaskan larvae grew slower, faster, or the same as Michigan larvae, depending upon host. Effects of host quality were greatest at high temperatures. Elevated respiratory expenses in Alaskan larvae (35% higher than Michigan larvae) made them especially sensitive to host quality at high temperatures. Dry matter digestibility and nitrogen use efficiency differed across hosts, but not between populations or across temperatures. Molting accounted for 35-51% of development time. Alaskan larvae completed their fifth molt faster than Michigan larvae at 12&deg; (11.8 vs. 17.8 d), but not at 30&deg; (3.1 vs. 2.9 d). In both populations, molt was more temperature sensitive than growth at low temperatures (Q10 of 5.65 vs. 3.04 from 12 to 18&deg;), but less temperature sensitive at high temperatures (Q10 of 1.60 vs. 2.06 from 18 to 30&deg;). Survival differed across temperatures, but not between populations. Under ideal basking conditions, larvae in the field were able to elevate body temperatures &asymp;10&deg; above ambient, but such conditions were rare in Alaska and larvae were usually near ambient temperature. Alaskan larvae were no better than Michigan larvae at selecting high radiation microsites or converting solar radiation into heat. Growth rates of Alaskan larvae were the same in the field and laboratory when fed the same foliage and exposed to the same mean daily air temperature. We incorporated P. canadensis temperature responses into a life history development model, then used a 48-yr climatic record to evaluate the fitness contributions of apparent adaptations to Alaskan summers. On a good host, at Alaskan temperatures, Alaskan P. canadensis had an estimated fitness 3.0 times greater than Michigan P. canadensis. Furthermore, the Michigan population was predicted to go extinct in 31 of 48 yr at Alaskan temperatures. Changes in growth temperature responses made the greatest contribution to enhanced fitness in Alaska, followed by increased mass of neonates, enhanced molting abilities at low temperatures, and a reduced size threshold for pupation. Analysis of fitness trade-offs suggested that extreme summers have been more important than average summers in shaping adaptive responses. Regional adaptation to climate allows P. canadensis to maintain a broader geographic distribution than would otherwise be possible, but northern distribution limits are probably still constrained by summer temperatures.

  abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different agricultural treatments and plant communities on the diversity of ammonia oxidizer populations in soil. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), coupled with specific oligonucleotide probing, was used to analyze 16S rRNA genes of ammonia oxidizers belonging to the beta subgroup of the division Proteobacteria by use of DNA extracted from cultivated, successional, and native deciduous forest soils. Community profiles of the different soil types were compared with nitrification rates and most-probable-number (MPN) counts. Despite significant variation in measured nitrification rates among communities, there were no differences in the DGGE banding profiles of DNAs extracted from these soils. DGGE profiles of DNA extracted from samples of MPN incubations, cultivated at a range of ammonia concentrations, showed the presence of bands not amplified from directly extracted DNA, Nitrosomonas-like bands were seen in the MPN DNA but were not detected in the DNA extracted directly from soils. These bands were detected in some samples taken from MPN incubations carried out with medium containing 1,000 mug of NH4+-N ml(-1), to the exclusion of bands detected in the native DNA, Cell concentrations of ammonia oxidizers determined by MPN counts were between 10- and 100-fold lower than those determined by competitive PCR (cPCR), Although no differences were seen in ammonia oxidizer MPN counts from the different soil treatments, cPCR revealed higher numbers in fertilized soils. The use of a combination of traditional and molecular methods to investigate the activities and compositions of ammonia oxidizers in soil demonstrates differences in fine-scale compositions among treatments that may be associated with changes in population size and function.

  abstract: "This article outlines an approach, based on ecosystem services, for assessing the trade-offs inherent in managing humans embedded in ecological systems. Evaluating these trade-offs requires an understanding of the biophysical magnitudes of the changes in ecosystem services that result from human actions, and of the impact of these changes on human welfare. We summarize the state of the art of ecosystem services-based management and the information needs for applying it. Three case studies of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites-coastal, urban, and agricultural-illustrate the usefulness, information needs, quantification possibilities, and methods for this approach. One example of the application of this approach, with rigorously established service changes and valuations taken front the literature, is used to illustrate the potential for full economic valuation of several agricultural landscape management options, including managing for water quality biodiversity, and crop productivity.

  title: 
  abstract: "Understanding the effects of tillage on soils following years or decades of no-till is critical for developing C conservation strategies. To date, short-term responses to tillage in previously uncultivated or other long-term no-till soils have primarily focused on total C changes, which are difficult to detect. Tillage effects on soil conservation and C permanence may be better predicted by changes in more readily detected factors known to affect C storage such as aggregation and physically protected C. We annually plowed replicated plots in a previously uncultivated midsuccessional field between 2002 and 2004 and investigated changes in the distribution of aggregates, physically protected C, and light fraction (LF) organic matter. Within 60 d of initial cultivation, soil aggregates in the 2000- to 8000-mu m size class declined from 0.47 to 0.15 g g(-1) at 0- to 7-cm soil depth and from 0.32 to 0.23 g g(-1) at 7 to 20 cm. Lower levels of aggregation persisted through the winter and spring of the following year. Inter-aggregate, unprotected light fraction (LF) increased following cultivation, as did particulate C in soil fractions with densities &lt; 1.9 g cm(-3). Changes in the mass of total soil C were not detectable after 3 yr but the vertical distribution of all soil C pools was altered by plowing. Our study demonstrates that plowing once immediately and substantially alters aggregation and LF and particulate C dynamics and that these conditions persist. Results suggest that no-till soils need to be continuously maintained to protect aggregation and physically stabilized C pools. "

  file_url: 
  title: 
  abstract: "Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and halocarbons in the atmosphere due to human activities are associated with global climate change. The concentration of N2O has increased by 16% since 1750. Although the atmospheric concentration of N2O is much smaller (314 ppb in 1998) than of CO2 (365 ppm), its global warming potential ( cumulative radiative forcing) is 296 times that of the latter in a 100-year time horizon. Currently, it contributes about 6% of the overall global warming effect but its contribution from the agricultural sector is about 16%. Of that, almost 80% of N2O is emitted from Australian agricultural lands, originating from N fertilisers (32%), soil disturbance (38%), and animal waste (30%).  Nitrous oxide is primarily produced in soil by the activities of microorganisms during nitrification, and denitrification processes. The ratio of N2O to N-2 production depends on oxygen supply or water-filled pore space, decomposable organic carbon, N substrate supply, temperature, and pH and salinity. N2O production from soil is sporadic both in time and space, and therefore, it is a challenge to scale up the measurements of N2O emission from a given location and time to regional and national levels. Estimates of N2O emissions from various agricultural systems vary widely. For example, in flooded rice in the Riverina Plains, N2O emissions ranged from 0.02% to 1.4% of fertiliser N applied, whereas in irrigated sugarcane crops, 15.4% of fertiliser was lost over a 4-day period. Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilised dairy pasture soils in Victoria range from 6 to 11 kg N2O-N/ ha, whereas in arable cereal cropping, N2O emissions range from &lt; 0.01% to 9.9% of N fertiliser applications. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil nitrite and nitrates resulting from residual fertiliser and legumes are rarely studied but probably exceed those from fertilisers, due to frequent wetting and drying cycles over a longer period and larger area. In ley cropping systems, significant N2O losses could occur, from the accumulation of mainly nitrate-N, following mineralisation of organic N from legume-based pastures. Extensive grazed pastures and rangelands contribute annually about 0.2 kg N/ha as N2O (93 kg/ha per year CO2-equivalent). Tropical savannas probably contribute an order of magnitude more, including that from frequent fires. Unfertilised forestry systems may emit less but the fertilised plantations emit more N2O than the extensive grazed pastures. However, currently there are limited data to quantify N2O losses in systems under ley cropping, tropical savannas, and forestry in Australia. Overall, there is a need to examine the emission factors used in estimating national N2O emissions; for example, 1.25% of fertiliser or animal- excreted N appearing as N2O (IPCC 1996). The primary consideration for mitigating N2O emissions from agricultural lands is to match the supply of mineral N ( from fertiliser applications, legume-fixed N, organic matter, or manures) to its spatial and temporal needs by crops/pastures/trees. Thus, when appropriate, mineral N supply should be regulated through slow-release (urease and/or nitrification inhibitors, physical coatings, or high C/N ratio materials) or split fertiliser application. Also, N use could be maximised by balancing other nutrient supplies to plants. Moreover, non-legume cover crops could be used to take up residual mineral N following N-fertilised main crops or mineral N accumulated following legume leys. For manure management, the most effective practice is the early application and immediate incorporation of manure into soil to reduce direct N2O emissions as well as secondary emissions from deposition of ammonia volatilised from manure and urine. Current models such as DNDC and DAYCENT can be used to simulate N2O production from soil after parameterisation with the local data, and appropriate modification and verification against the measured N2O emissions under different management practices. In summary, improved estimates of N2O emission from agricultural lands and mitigation options can be achieved by a directed national research program that is of considerable duration, covers sampling season and climate, and combines different techniques ( chamber and micrometeorological) using high precision analytical instruments and simulation modelling, under a range of strategic activities in the agriculture sector.

  title: 
  abstract: "The absolute amount of microbial biomass and relative contribution of fungi and bacteria are expected to vary among types of organic matter (OM) within a stream and will vary among streams because of differences in organic matter quality and quantity. Common types of benthic detritus [leaves, small wood, and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM)] were sampled in 9 small (1st-3rd order) streams selected to represent a range of important controlling factors such as surrounding vegetation, detritus standing stocks, and water chemistry. Direct counts of bacteria and measurements of ergosterol (a fungal sterol) were used to describe variation in bacterial and fungal biomass. There were significant differences in bacterial abundance among types of organic matter with higher densities per unit mass of organic matter on fine particles relative to either leaves or wood surfaces. In contrast, ergosterol concentrations were significantly greater on leaves and wood, confirming the predominance of fungal biomass in these larger size classes. In general, bacterial abundance per unit organic matter was less variable than fungal biomass, suggesting bacteria will be a more predictable component of stream microbial communities. For 7 of the 9 streams, the standing stock of fine benthic organic matter was large enough that habitat-weighted reach-scale bacterial biomass was equal to or greater than fungal biomass. The quantities of leaves and small wood varied among streams such that the relative contribution of reach-scale fungal biomass ranged from 10% to as much as 90% of microbial biomass. Ergosterol concentrations were positively associated with substrate C:N ratio while bacterial abundance was negatively correlated with C:N. Both these relationships are confounded by particle size, i.e., leaves and wood had higher C:N than fine benthic organic matter. There was a weak positive relationship between bacterial abundance and streamwater soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, but no apparent pattern between either bacteria or fungi and streamwater dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The variation in microbial biomass per unit organic matter and the relative abundance of different types of organic matter contributed equally to driving differences in total microbial biomass at the reach scale.

  abstract: "The immediate effects of tillage on protected soil C and N pools and on trace gas emissions from soils at precultivation levels of native C remain largely unknown. We measured the response to cultivation of CO2 and N2O emissions and associated environmental factors in a previously uncultivated U.S. Midwest Alfisol with C concentrations that were indistinguishable from those in adjacent late successional forests on the same soil type (3.2%). Within 2 days of initial cultivation in 2002, tillage significantly (P=0.001, n=4) increased CO2 fluxes from 91 to 196 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) and within the first 30 days higher fluxes because of cultivation were responsible for losses of 85 g CO2-C m(-2). Additional daily C losses were sustained during a second and third year of cultivation of the same plots at rates of 1.9 and 1.0 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Associated with the CO2 responses were increased soil temperature, substantially reduced soil aggregate size (mean weight diameter decreased 35% within 60 days), and a reduction in the proportion of intraaggregate, physically protected light fraction organic matter. Nitrous oxide fluxes in cultivated plots increased 7.7-fold in 2002, 3.1-fold in 2003, and 6.7-fold in 2004 and were associated with increased soil NO3- concentrations, which approached 15 mu g N g(-1). Decreased plant N uptake immediately after tillage, plus increased mineralization rates and fivefold greater nitrifier enzyme activity, likely contributed to increased NO3- concentrations. Our results demonstrate that initial cultivation of a soil at precultivation levels of native soil C immediately destabilizes physical and microbial processes related to C and N retention in soils and accelerates trace gas fluxes. Policies designed to promote long-term C sequestration may thus need to protect soils from even occasional cultivation in order to preserve sequestered C. "

  abstract: "Environmental research in agriculture is today largely reactive, focused on problems at small scales and conducted within narrow disciplinary boundaries. This approach has worked to abate a number of environmental problems created by agriculture, but it has not provided effective solutions for many of the most recalcitrant ones. Furthermore, the approach fails to position agriculture to deliver new environmental benefits that the public and policymakers increasingly demand. A new vision is needed for environmental research in agriculture-one that is anticipatory; promotes long-term, systems-level research at multiple scales; better incorporates important interactions between the biophysical and social sciences; and provides for the proper evaluation of deployed solutions. Achieving this vision will require major changes in funding strategies, in institutional reward structures, and in policies that presently inhibit collaborations across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. It is, nevertheless, time to act. "

  title: 
  abstract: "(1) Seed-bank species composition and seed density were determined in an annually ploughed field at the Kellogg Biological Station in south-western Michigan, U.S.A. using three different methods: direct germination, germination following cold-stratification, and washing using a modified elutriation system. A fourth method, flotation on a salt-density gradient was abandoned after preliminary trials showed it was inefficient and inaccurate.  (2) Twenty soil cores (2.5 cm in diameter, 15 cm deep) were taken from each of twenty-five sampling points in the field. Cores were divided into three depth intervals (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm and 5-15 cm) and five cores from each quarter of a sampling quadrat were combined and randomly assigned to one of the four methods for estimating the seed bank. (3) A total of fifty species was detected in the seed bank of this community. Overall, more species were detected with cold-stratification (forty-two species) than with direct germination (thirty-seven) or elutriation (thirty-five). Plots of species-sampling-area curves showed that fifteen to twenty sampling locations were sufficient to determine the number of species present in the seed bank with any of these methods. (4) Seed-density estimates were significantly higher in the elutriated samples. This was due primarily to the inclusion of inviable seeds in the counts from the elutriated samples. (5) There were significant differences in seed viability among species recovered in the elutriated samples. Both Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Chenopodium album, seeds of which were common in the samples, had low viability (25% and 3%, respectively). (6) Germination methods (particularly when more than one pre-treatment method is used) provide a more complete listing of species present in the soil seed bank of a community than elutriation. However, elutriation methods may be more useful for documenting variation in seed distributions on a large spatial scale or in quantifying the distribution of species with unique, easily identifiable seeds. Elutriation seems particularly well-suited for quantifying the distribution of plants that are considered weeds in agricultural systems, because many of these species have seeds that are easily identified and retain viability when dried.

  abstract: "We present a calculation for soil microbial biomass N:C ratio determined from a 10-d incubation following chloroform fumigation. The calculation is based on a mathematical model of the N content of the pre- and post-fumigation soil microbial biomass and the growth yield of the biomass that develops after fumigation. Biomass N is calculated from the N:C ratio and biomass C. The mineralization of bacteria and fungi, with different N contents, added to fumigated soils was used to establish the model parameters. The model was tested against an independent set of measurements and considers two assumptions: 1) The ratio of N:C mineralized from killed biomass is equal to the ratio of N:C mineralized from soil non-biomass constituents. 2) More realistically, the N and C mineralization in the fumigated soil, from sources other than killed biomass, is a residual fraction of the N and C mineralization in the unfumigated soil. Biomass C:N ratios calculated without a control correction (assumption 1) were, on average, 20% wider than corrected values (assumption 2). Biomass N calculated as the product of N:C and biomass C was compared with published values for several data sets. The new calculation method was robust even when net immobilization of N followed fumigation. "

  title: The Use of Ecosystems Knowledge in Farmer Design of Crop Production Systems
  abstract: Crop systems are designed and integrated by farmers based, first of al, on economic and physical resources available within the constraints of climate. Design is influenced by farmer preferences, the regulatory environment, and a host of other factors (<a href="Figures/harwod_fig1.htm">Figure 1</a>). The selection of crop and cover crop paterns and diversity is based on agronomic research done primarily in an empirical maner. As ecosystem science is aplied to production systems we are achieving an understanding of proces-level and relational changes in the biology and biogeochemistry of production systems. In most cases production ecology research is linked to outcomes in terms of productivity, and the quantity and quality of ecosystem services. Rarely does it deal with economic eficiency and profitability. On the structure and input side, in ecosystem research rarely do we consider systems structure and inputs as continuous variables. We select specific &quot;treatments&quot; thought to give a response in the proces under study. We then busy ourselves with the definition of the dynamics at the proces level.If farmers are to include ecosystem knowledge in their design proces they ned information on how a gradient of inputs, diversity, or crop sequence afects ecosystem proces which, in turn, influence outcome. Ecosystems researchers typicaly deal with inputs (treatments) in the most cursory fashion in the shortest posible &quot;materials and methods&quot; section of research reporting. That portion is of most interest to a farmer. It describes the treatments or &quot;tols&quot; available to influence proces, and ultimately, outcome.As several of us work with you to translate findings for farmer (and extension) use, we wil be extracting as much understanding as posible on &quot;points of biological intervention (PBI)&quot;. We wil be key-wording and categorizing them.The Living Field Laboratory (LFL) has ben designed around gradients of plant diversity and chemical subsidy. Our students are quantifying and modeling how continuous management variables influence key soil carbon and nitrogen proceses which, in turn, have a major impact on desired outcome. The research is specificaly designed to bridge the gaps in aplied fashion, betwen management, proces, and outcome. We use relevant LTER treatments as benchmarks.It sems highly likely that the form of PBIs wil difer with the type of proces. Biogeochemical proces information wil be diferent in form from that of organism population structure, and diferent stil for pest/predator relationships.

  title: 
  abstract: "Proliferation of roots in a nutrient patch can occur either as a result of an increase in root length (morphological response) or by a change in root birth or death rates (demographic responses). In this study we attempted to distinguish between these two mechanisms of response to nutrient patches and to compare the responses of four old-field plant species (two annuals, two perennials). For all four species combined, there were significant increases in root numbers and root length in fertilized patches. Root proliferation in fertilized patches was largely due to increased birth ( = branching) rates of new roots. However, there was also a significant increase in root death rates in the fertilized patches which reduced the magnitude of the increase in net root numbers. Plots for individual species suggested they differed in the magnitude and timing of root proliferation in fertilized patches due to differences in root birth and death rates. However, because of the limited sample size in this study, there was only a marginally significant difference among species in root birth rates, and no difference in death rates. Further studies are currently underway to better quantify species differences in the demographic mechanism, as well as magnitude, of response to nutrient patches and if this would affect the ability to exploit small-scale heterogeneity in soil resources.

  title: 
  abstract: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are integral components of grasslands because most plants are associated with interconnected networks of AM hyphae. Mycorrhizae generally facilitate plant uptake of nutrients from the soil. However, mycorrhizal associations are known to vary in their mutualistic function, and there is currently no metric that links AM functioning with fungal colonization of roots. Mycorrhizal structures differ in their physiological and ecological functioning, so changes in AM allocation to intraradical (inside roots) and extraradical (in soil) structures may signal shifts in mycorrhizal function. We hypothesize that the functional equilibrium model applies to AM fungi and that fertilization should reduce allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae, the fungal structures that are directly involved in nutrient acquisition and transfer to plants. This study compared AM responses to experimental N enrichment at five grasslands distributed across North America. Samples were collected from replicated N-enriched (and some P-enriched) and control plots throughout the growing season for three years. Intraradical AM structures were measured in over 1400 root samples, extraradical hyphal density was measured in over 590 soil samples, and spore biovolume was analyzed in over 400 soil samples. There were significant site X N interactions for spore biovolume, extraradical hyphae, intraradical hyphae, and vesicles. Nitrogen enrichment strongly decreased AM structures at Cedar Creek, the site with the lowest soil N:P, and it increased AM structures at Konza Prairie, the site with the highest soil N:P. As predicted by the functional equilibrium model, in soils with sufficient P, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae was generally reduced by N enrichment. Allocation to spores and hyphae was most sensitive to fertilization. At the mesic sites, this response was associated with a shift in the relative abundance of Gigasporaceae within AM fungal communities. This study demonstrates that N enrichment impacts mycorrhizal allocation across a wide range of grassland ecosystems. Such changes are important because they suggest an alteration in mycorrhizal functioning that, in turn, may impact plant community composition and ecosystem function.

  abstract: "Cover crop roots and shoots release carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) compounds in situ during their decomposition. Depending upon the season, these C and N compounds may be sequestered, the C may be respired or the N may be leached below the root zone. A field study was established to identify the contributions of cover crop root and shoot N to different regions within aggregates in the Ap horizon of a Kalamazoo loam soil. Fall-planted rye plants (Secale cerealeL.) were labeled the next May with foliar applications of solutions containing 99% atom (15NH4)2SO4. Isotopic enrichment of soil aggregates ranging from 2.0 to 4.0, 4.0\x966.3 and 6.3\x969.5 mm across was determined following plant residue applications. Concentric layers of aggregates were removed from each aggregate by newly designed meso soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chambers. Non-uniform distributions of total N and recently derived rye N in soil macroaggregates, across time, suggested that the formations and functions of macroaggregates are very dynamics processes and soil aggregates influence where N is deposited. Early in the season, more 15N migrated to the interior regions of the smallest aggregates, 2\x964 mm across, but it was limited to only surfaces and transitional regions of the larger aggregates, 6.3\x969.3 mm across. Exterior layers of aggregates between 6.0 and 9.5 mm retained 1.6% of the Nderived from roots in July 1999, which was three times more than their interior regions. This was slightly greater than the % Nderived from shoot. One month later, as the maize root absorption of N increased rapidly, % Nderived from roots and % Nderived from shoot were nearly equal in exterior layers and interior regions of soil aggregates. This equilibrium distribution may have been from either greater diffusion of N within the aggregates and/or maize root removal form aggregate exteriors. Results supported that most of roots grew preferentially around surfaces of soil aggregates rather than through aggregates. Cover crop roots contributed as much N as cover crop shoots to the total soil N pool. Subsequent crops use N from the most easily accessible zones of soil structure, which are surfaces of larger soil aggregates. Therefore maintaining active plant roots and aggregated soil structure in the soil enhances N sequestration and maximize soil N availability. These studies suggest that the rapid and perhaps bulk flow of soil N solutions may bypass many of the central regions of soil aggregates, resulting in greater leaching losses."

At the regional scale the efect of intensive management practices on heat and water vapor distribution in the surface-atmosphere system is not wel understod. A preliminary study is being initiated to evaluate the efect of intensive management practices on heat and water vapor transfer in croped vs. old growth comunities at Michigan State University 's Kelog Biological Station.In-situ measurements of air, soil, and surface temperatures have ben colected in corn, soybean, and alfalfa fields, grasland and forest sites since 197.

These data wil be used to analyze the heat and water vapor distribution in croped and native forest comunities by the surface energy balance equation, and the Bowen Ratio and Penman-Monteith methods.Contingent on the available funding, the long term goals of this study are to: (1) determine the spatial and temporal distribution of net radiation and ET in selected habitats at the KBS LTER site , (2) examine the relationships betwen net radiation, ET, and above ground net primary productivity (ANP) in the croped and old growth forest comunities, and (3) compare the distribution of heat and water vapor fluxes in the land surface-atmosphere system in crop system representing high management and old growth forest representing low management. These results wil improve our understanding of the heat and water vapor distribution in the Great Lakes agricultural ecosystems and wil lead to reduced uncertainties in measuring, maping and modeling vegetation under variable hydrological and climate systems."

    The Effects of Field Crop
    Ecology on C and N Pools in Sustainable System

  abstract: |-
    The Effects of Field Crop
    Ecology on C and N Pools in Sustainable SystemConventional farming practices can result in
    significant C and N loss from the soil. The use of organic
    amendments in place of N fertilizer can provide crop nutrient
    requirements, build C and N stores, and improve soil quality
    parameters. The implementation of sustainable agriculture
    techniques should cause C an N to cycle differently than in a
    conventional cropping system. Ideally slow and active pools of N in
    particular would increase in size and respond more rapidly to
    environmental stress. Sustainable agriculture management practices
    that include: rotations, cover crops, and compost change the flow
    of C and N in the active and slow soil pools. Fluctuations in C and
    N pools affect the amount of plant available N in a cropping
    system. Conditions under grasslands are ideal for C and N storage.
    Slow pools of N and C are larger and the grassland system is more
    rapid in responding to decreases in inorganic N as compared to
    conventional cropping systems.Field sites will be located at Kellogg Biological
    Station in Hickory Corners, MI. All cropping treatments will be
    located on the Living Field Lab. The LFL has a factorial design
    that allows for the comparison of a number of interactions. These
    interactions include: differences in management practices
    (Integrated-Fertilizer vs. Integrated-Compost), rotation effects,
    and cover crops. The rotation consists of the following crops in
    the order listed, corn (Zea mays L.)/ corn,/soybean
    (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum). Cover crops
    vary depending upon the point in the rotation. Crimson clover
    (Trifolium incarnatum L.) is seeded to 1st yr.
    corn, 2nd yr. corn is in rye grass (lolium
    multiflorum), soybeans have no cover, and red clover
    (Trifolium pratense L.) is seeded into wheat
    plots.The LFL does not contain a fallow treatment or
    grassland. Therefore, a grassland treatment on the Long-Term
    Ecological Research (LTER) plots will be compared to the LFL
    cropping systems. Four replicates of the historically tilled,
    successional grassland treatment will be incorporated into our
    research. The replicates that will be sampled on the LTER are: T7
    r2, T7 r3, T7 r5, and T7 r6. Replicates 1 and 4 were not chosen due
    to the large amount of woody vegetation present. The LTER
    statistical design is a randomized complete block.This study will focus on the initial release of
    inorganic N from plant residues and compost, the incorporation of
    residue and compost materials into the active and slow pools of
    SOM, and subsequent release of plant available inorganic N from the
    active and slow pools. The effect each point in the crop rotation
    has on potentially mineralizable N will be assessed separately and
    in conjunction with cover crops and/or compost. The release of N
    from plant residues and subsequent incorporation of residues into
    SOM will be evaluated using an in situ buried bag experiment.
    Estimates of rate constants and sizes of active and slow pools of
    soil C and N will be estimated from long term incubations. The flow
    of C from corn and N from clover cover crops will be traced through
    particulate organic matter fraction (POM) using isotopic
    signatures, 13C and 15N. Modeling with SALUS
    will determine the length of time required for C and N pools in
    each system to reach a steady state. Our research will provide
    growers with information on the quantity of potentially
    mineralizable N at various points in the rotation and the impact
    compost and/or cover crops have on potentially mineralizable N.
    This additional knowledge of C and N cycling will allow farmers to
    manage: rotations, compost applications, and cover crops in a
    manner in which plant available N can be optimized at the
    appropriate time for a given crop. Modeling will allow us to
    simulate future effects of rotations and inputs. As pools of C and
    N in the systems reach a steady state, changes in farm management
    practices that may be required can be addressed prior to
    implementation.Previous LFL Soil Quality
    Research.&nbsp; Prior scientific investigators emphasized
    changes in N mineralization rates over a growing season as affected
    by crop rotation, cover crop, and compost (Willson et al., In
    press). It was determined that N mineralization fit a seasonal
    pattern (Fig. 1). Kinetics of the active N pool in compost plots
    were found to be significantly different from those of N fertilizer
    treatments. In the 1st yr of compost application mineralization
    rates increased 23%. Three years of compost additions resulted in:
    a 12% increase in the pool of mineralizable N, a 27% decrease in
    MRT, and a 28% reduction in inorganic N without decreased yields.
    Treatments that contained legume cover crops manifested short-term
    increases in potential mineralization rates and a slight decrease
    in MRT. Thus, the data suggest that the use of compost may increase
    C and N mineralization across the entire season (as opposed to
    several weeks) and maximize storage of soil C and N. This may
    increase active and slow pools of C and N, as well as, the rate of
    N and C cycling between active and slow pools.On-Going Soil Quality Research Related to the
    LTER.&nbsp; Previous research on the LFL has suggested that
    active soil N pools have increased in compost treatments. The rate
    of N cycling has been augmented. These increases should also be
    reflected in C pools. The completion of two rotation cycles may
    reveal similar changes in N and C pools due to crop ecology and
    cover crop use. A basic premise of sustainable agriculture is that
    inputs can be decreased and nutrient cycling increased without
    decreasing yields. The use of crop ecology and N sources other than
    N fertilizer are expected to facilitate C and N cycling between
    active and slow pools. Unmanaged systems such as successional
    grasslands are ideal for C and N storage. Slow pools of N and C are
    larger and the grassland system responds more rapidly to decreases
    in inorganic N as compared to conventional cropping systems. Thus,
    there is a potential agronomic benefit to applying ecological
    principles to agriculture.Carbon and N mineralization from 150d incubations
    on several agronomic treatments will be compared to treatment 7 of
    the LTER&rsquo;s, previously tilled-successional grassland.
    Treatment 7 will be used as a base line for comparison of shifts in
    cropping treatments. Grassland treatments tend to have greater C
    and N mineralization potential during laboratory incubations. A
    decomposition/POM fraction study has been initiated on treatment 7
    of the LTER and several LFL treatments. Crop residues from the LFL
    will be buried in LTER plots. The decomposition and incorporation
    of crop residues into POM on the successional grassland will be
    contrasted with data from agronomic treatments on the
    LFL.

  abstract: "A major challenge in evaluating patterns of species richness and productivity involves acquiring data to examine these relationships empirically across a range of ecologically significant spatial scales. In this paper, we use data from herb-dominated plant communities at six Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to examine how the relationship between plant species density and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) differs when the spatial scale of analysis is changed. We quantified this relationship at different spatial scales in which we varied the focus and extent of analysis: (1) among fields within communities, (2) among fields within biomes or biogeographic regions, and (3) among communities within biomes or biogeographic regions. We used species density (D = number of species per m(2)) as our measure of diversity to have a comparable index across all sites and scales. Although we expected unimodal relationships at all spatial scales, we found that spatial scale influenced the form of the relationship. At the scale of fields within different grassland communities, we detected a significant relationship at only one site (Minnesota old-fields), and it was negative linear. When we expanded the extent of analyses to biogeographic regions (grasslands or North America), we found significant unimodal relationships in both cases. However, when we combined data to examine patterns among community types within different biogeographic regions (grassland, alpine tundra, arctic tundra, or North America), we did not detect significant relationships between species density and ANPP for any region. The results of our analyses demonstrate that the spatial scale of analysis - how data are aggregated and patterns examined can influence the form of the relationship between species density and productivity. It also demonstrates the need for data sets from a broad spectrum of sites sampled over a range of scales for examining challenging and controversial ecological hypotheses. "

  title: Cover Crop Absorption and Dep Leching Reductions of Soil N in Corn Agroecosystems
  abstract: "Alfalfa increased mineral soil N by decreasing leaching loses of fixed plant and residual soil nitrogen (Rase and Smucker, 19). Soil and plant nitrogen pols were studied under rye cover croping of a Kalamazo loam soil (mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) from 197 to 19 under four regimes of soil and plant residues: 1) bare falow soil (F), 2) bare falow soil with rye shot mulch aplied in May (FS), 3) bare soil with rye rots (shots removed) in May (R), and 4) rye cover with rye rots and shot mulch aplied to the soil surface in May (RS). Extractable soil N was maximum in April 198 in F treatments. R treatments delayed maximum acumulations of soil N until August 198. Rye cover crops decreased soil N by nearly 160 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>during the wet periods from December 197 to April 198. Much of this N was absorbed by the rye cover. Rye cover retained more of the remaining soil N in the uper soil horizons within reach of rots by the sucesive corn crop. After spring kiling of the rye cover, soil extractable N contents increased 150 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, from 192 to 342 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>. These results sugest that rots of winter rye cover sequester soil N and reduce dep leaching of soluble soil N when compared to bare falow soil. This timely sequestered and slow-release soil N can be used by suceding corn plants reducing fertilizer costs and NO<sub>3</sub> leaching from the soil profile.Figures 1 and 2"

    Weathering of
    Garnet and Chain-Silicates in Forest and Agricultural Soils at the
    Kellogg Biological Station and Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory LTER
    Sites, and Other Great Lakes and Southern Blue Ridge Regional
    Localities
  abstract: |-
    Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations
    of garnets and chain-silicate minerals (pyroxenes and amphiboles)
    were conducted to qualitatively characterize their weathering
    textures as a function of weathering regime, parent material, and
    land use. Samples were collected from soils developed on weathered
    glacial deposits (including an agricultural field and a deciduous
    forest at Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) LTER site in Battle
    Creek, Michigan and a deciduous forest at Sanford Natural Area in
    East Lansing, Michigan), and from deep saprolitic weathering
    profiles of the Carroll Knob Complex at the Coweeta Hydrologic
    Laboratory Southern Hardwood Forest LTER site (North Carolina) and
    the Laurel Creek Complex (Georgia). The chain-silicate minerals at
    all locations and under all land-use regimes exhibit the same types
    of weathering morphologies as observed at the other sites, and as
    previously reported elsewhere, despite differences in parent
    material, geomorphic history, presence/absence and identity of
    secondary-minerals (weathering products), vegetation, and land
    use.Garnets from all Michigan localities exhibit a
    wide range of features, including features apparently inherited
    from their source rocks, and features formed during glacial
    transport. Widespread preservation of inherited pre-pedogenic
    surface textures suggests that garnet in Michigan soils has
    undergone little weathering since deglaciation. Garnets from the
    Michigan localities appear less weathered than garnets from other
    weathered glacial deposits in Canada. The garnets collected from
    KBS (both forested and agricultural soils) differed from those
    collected at Sanford Natural Area in that those from KBS have
    well-formed etch pits on their surfaces while those from Sanford
    are relatively unweathered. It is unclear why KBS garnets are more
    etched than Sanford garnets.Garnet weathering features formed during
    prolonged deep saprolitic weathering at the Coweeta Hydrologic
    Laboratory Southern Hardwood Forest LTER site are distinctly
    different from those developed on post-glacial soils in Michigan,
    and closely resemble weathering features developed in many
    (oxidizing) lateritic and saprolitic regoliths. Pre-weathering
    (parent-material) surface textures are completely obliterated by
    weathering at Coweeta. Layers of gibbsite and goethite replace
    iron-bearing (almandine) garnet in saprolitic weathering
    environments; etch pits are uncommon on garnet in the saprolite.
    However, in many soils, almandine surfaces are directly exposed to
    soil solutions. These grains exhibit numerous well-formed etch
    pits. Garnet etch pits at Coweeta are larger, more abundant, and
    crystallographically better developed than at KBS.Garnets in Michigan glacial soils are minimally
    weathered compared with Coweeta garnets; this suggests that the
    relative extent of garnet grain-surface modification by weathering
    depends on the length of time the material has been exposed to
    weathering. It may be that the time required to develop diagnostic
    weathering textures on garnet is longer than the age of Michigan
    soils. However, chain-silicates in Michigan soils appear to have
    weathered to a degree comparable to Coweeta chain-silicates, so
    regolith age alone may not be sufficient to explain differences in
    garnet surface textures. Further work is required to determine
    whether differences in soil-solution chemistry among sites are
    sufficient to explain the preservation and apparent passivity of
    pre-pedogenic garnet surfaces in Michigan soils. Work to estimate
    the "response time" of garnet and chain-silicate surface textures
    to environmental change is in progress.

This factorial experiment included two defoliation treatments (defoliated and a foliated control) and fertilization treatments (100 kg nitrogen (N) ha\x961 and an unfertilized control). Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) populations were experimentally increased to obtain defoliation in the summers of 1996, 1997 and 1998; fertilization subplots were supplemented with NH4NO3 (100 kg N ha\x961) in the spring of each year. Despite the severity of defoliation, the effects were small, and significant on only two sampling dates: in May 1997, when fine root %CT was 23% lower in the defoliated trees, and in November 1997, when trees in the defoliated unfertilized plots had 35% higher root %CT than trees in all other plots. Defoliation effects on root %CT did not follow the same seasonal pattern as defoliation effects on root starch content, N uptake capacity or leaf %CT. Regulation of root condensed tannin concentration appeared to be partially uncoupled from these traits. The small transient effects on root defense reflect the resilience of this early successional tree to severe early season defoliation."

  title: "Gypsy Moth Defoliation of Hybrid Poplar: Efects on Growth, Carbohydrates, and Rot Demography"
  abstract: Defoliation efects on tres should cascade through the entire ecosystem, altering fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen as wel as changing the quality and quantity of resources available to herbivores and to the soil biota. We examined the dynamics of changes in tre carbon alocation during and imediately after defoliation of hybrid poplar caused by gypsy moth. We found symptoms consistent with declining carbon alocation to starch synthesis and rot production caused by defoliation. Both rot production (<a href="Figures/Kosola_fig1.htm">Fig. 1A</a>) and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) in al rot, trunk and twig samples (<a href="Figures/kosola_fig2.htm">Fig. 2</a>) were lower in the defoliated treatment. The efects on starch production were transient, and disapeared by the end of that same growing season. Contrary to our expectations, rot survivorship was not afected by defoliation (<a href="Figures/Kosola_fig1.htm">Fig. 1B</a>). The timing of defoliation and the phenology of poplar both play a role in determining the impact of defoliation on the tre. Gypsy moth, as an early-season defoliator, does not remove leaves late in the season when poplar C alocation is primarily directed belowground. Furthermore, even during the highest population densities of 197, the leaf meristems and youngest, unexpanded leaves were not eaten by the caterpilar, leaving a large potential leaf area ready to expand and photosynthesize as son as pupation started. The tres were poised to recover very rapidly folowing defoliation. As a consequence, the LTER poplars were relatively tolerant to defoliation by gypsy moth.

    Managing
    Nitrogen Mineralization Potential and Biologically Active Organic
    Matter Fractions in Agricultural Soils
  abstract: |-
    As in most terrestrial ecosystems, the
    productivity of row-crop agriculture is often limited by the
    availability of inorganic N. Nitrogen deficiency can be overcome by
    the use of inorganic N fertilizers or by the management of
    biological resources such as plant residues and organic
    fertilizers. An oversupply of inorganic N from either source can
    lead to economic losses and environmental contamination through
    increased leaching and denitrification. As farmers increase their
    use of biological resources in search of more sustainable
    production strategies, it will become increasingly important to
    determine how their management decisions effect the supply of
    inorganic N and to be able to adjust fertilizer recommendations
    accordingly.My dissertation research focuses on the effects
    of agricultural management and early plant succession on the
    storage and release of organic C and N in KBS soils. I compared the
    seasonal changes in N mineralization potential (NMP) with seasonal
    changes in C and N content of microbial biomass (MB) and
    macrooganic matter (MM) across a variety of corn-based agricultural
    rotations and successional treatments the LTER main site and the
    nearby Living Field Laboratory (LFL). I measured NMP based on the
    accumulation of inorganic N in soils during long term (150 or 310
    day) laboratory incubations at 25&deg; C. Microbial biomass was
    measured using the chloroform fumigation, incubation method (CFIM)
    and MM was defined as the C and N content in the 53-250 m m and
    250-100m m size classes of dispersed soil separates.Figure 1 shows
    the relationship between the accumulation of inorganic N in
    laboratory incubations and the MM C content of soils from LTER
    treatments 1 (Conventional), 7 (Historically Tilled), 8 (Never
    Tilled) and the tilled microplots in treatment 7 (Annually Tilled)
    across 5 sample dates in 1995 and 1996. The untilled successional
    treatments (7 and 8) had greater NMP than either the tilled
    successional treatments or any of the agronomic treatments. Among
    the agronomic treatments, those that received organic fertilizer in
    the form of compost and those that incorporating leguminous cover
    crops as green manure tended to have greater NMP than treatments
    receiving inorganic fertilizers and no cover crops. Nitrogen
    mineralization potential generally decreased from April to early
    fall (September or October) in all treatments, although it tended
    to recover in November.The strong correlation between MNP and MM shown
    in Fig, 1 was consistent across all treatments and dates in this
    study, although MM tends to reach maximum and minimum levels
    somewhat later than NMP. As a result, the relationship between NMP
    and MM C tends to change throughout the season (Fig. 2) with greater NMP per unit MM C
    in April and November than in October. A similar pattern was found
    in 1995-96. Our interpretation is that NMP reflects both
    mineralizable N in MM and the mineralizable N in recently deposited
    plant residues. The former is relatively constant over the season
    while the latter reaches a minimum in September-October.Microbial biomass was not correlated with N
    mineralization, although it was correlated with 10 day C
    mineralization. There was a dramatic decline in MB C in all
    treatments in June, 1994, apparently the result of a prolonged
    drought that spring. Microbial biomass tended to peak in the warm
    summer months (July-September), which also suggests that
    environmental conditions rather than substrate availability
    controls seasonal changes in microbial biomass at this
    site.These results are being submitted for publication
    as references 1 and 2 below. A third paper based on this study
    (reference 3) generates a simplified N budget for the LFL
    treatments and compares the NMP, MM C and N, and MB C and N
    measurements at each sample date to estimated field mineralization,
    yield, crop uptake and loss in the current and subsequent growing
    season in an attempt to determine which of these measurements was
    is the best measurement of N availability, crop performance, and N
    loss.Additional projects not related to my
    dissertation include the below ground productivity project (BGP) in
    which we are using 13C natural abundance to follow corn
    and alfalfa C into soil fractions and mineralization pools and a
    fertilization experiment in which I use 15N labeled
    fertilizer and 13C natural abundance to follow the fate
    of sidedress fertilizer N and corn C over two years of corn
    production. These papers should be completed this fall.T.C.

  abstract: "Differences among plant species in morphology and patterns of growth are assumed to influence their ability to acquire resources and, consequently, their competitive ability. Despite the acknowledged importance of below-ground resources for plant growth, our knowledge of species differences in root morphology of non-agricultural plants is limited. Comparisons of root morphology, growth rate and topology of seedlings of 12 herbaceous plant species that occur in early to mid-successional fields revealed significant differences among species that were largely related to life history. Annuals grew faster and produced longer and more branched roots than did biennials and perennials. Only among the annuals was there a positive correlation between seed mass and root growth. The grasses allocated proportionately more biomass to roots than the dicots, but did not differ in root length or branching pattern. As seedlings, all 12 species exhibited a herringbone topology; although after 10 d there were significant differences in topology between annuals and perennials indicating that the annuals had begun to develop a more dichotomously branched root system. The possible effects of early differences in root morphology among life-history types in acquiring soil resources in heterogeneous and successional environments are discussed. "

  abstract: "Fluctuating asymmetries are small random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry that result from imperfect regulation of development. Recently, fluctuating asymmetry has been suggested as a tool for monitoring levels of ecological stress within and between populations. Unfortunately, such comparisons of fluctuating asymmetry may be confounded by genetic or age differences among environments. In this study we use a genetically controlled field experiment to determine differences in fluctuating asymmetry due solely to different competitive regimes. We determined fluctuating asymmetry in poplar leaf shape for leaves taken from an even-aged clone grown in six different competitive regimes. We show that increases in intra- and interspecific competition increase fluctuating asymmetry in the leaves of this clone. This supports the use of fluctuating asymmetry as a tool for detecting common environmental stresses such as competition. "

The objectives of this study were to: (i)describe and quantify variability of total C in three management systems, chisel-plow (CT) and no-till (NT) with conventional chemical inputs and a chisel-plow organic management practice with cover crops (CT-cover) 15 yr after conversion from conventional management;(ii) assess the strengths of spatial correlation in the three studied systems; and (iii) evaluate contributions of topography and texture to the overall total C variability and its spatial components. The data were collected at 12 60 by 60 m plots at the Long Term Ecological Research site, Kellogg Biological Station, MI. The data consisted of elevation measurements taken on a 2 by 5 m grid and a total of 1160measurements of total C, sand, silt, and clay contents taken from the0- to 5-cm depth. Overall variability of total C in NT was more than four times greater than in CT, and in CT-cover the variability was more than two times greater than CT. Spatial correlation of total C was the strongest in NT, followed by CT-cover, and then by CT. Stronger spatial structures in NT and CT-cover were found to form in response to topographical and texture gradients. Effects of texture were largely associated with topographical effects; however, even when topography was controlled for, texture still substantially contributed to explaining total C variability."

  title: Efect of Agricultura Practices on Wed Comunity Dynamics
  abstract: "The development of alternative wed management strategies requires a clear understanding of the mechanisms conditioning the establishment, growth and reproduction of invasive plants. This study evaluates the efect of comon agricultural practices on wed comunity dynamics at the KBS LTER site. Specificaly, it adreses the folowing questions: 1) what is the relationship betwen wed comunity composition and habitat stability?, 2) do diferent agricultural practices favor the establishment of certain life-history groups?, 3) is wed comunity composition determined by the presence of a given crop, the agricultural practice employed or a combination of both factors? Aboveground wed biomas by species was sampled each year (193-98) at the peak of their ocurence at treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4 using five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat (0.5 m x 2.0 m) in each treatment and block combination. Al plants roted in the quadrat were cliped, separated by species, dried to constant weight, and weighed. More species per sample plot were sampled in treatment 3 and 4 (low chemical inputs) than in treatment 1 and 2 (conventional chemical inputs). A multivariate ordination analysis indicated that chemical input is a main factor conditioning wed comunity characteristics (<a href=\"Figures/menaled_fig1.htm\">Fig. 1</a>). Spearman corelation coeficients showed that the number and biomas of perenial species were negatively asociated with chemical inputs. Evaluation of Euclidean distances among sample sites sugested that year to year variation in wed comunities were larger in conventional treatments than in low-input ones. A corelation analysis betwen site variables such as soil characteristics, crop yield and sed bank composition wil be performed to explore mechanisms responsible for wed comunity variations as a function of agricultural practices."

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for developing and integrating a set of hydrological and biologic indicators that can show the modified spatial and temporal distributions of hydrological and biological conditions which result from land use/cover changes across the study watersheds by using Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, multiple physical and biological databases, and simulation models. Effects of management practices and programs can be evaluated by comparing the temporal distributions of these indicators over a certain period. The paper further outlines steps needed to bridge the gaps between the largely physical and structural aspects of research on watershed indicators and the work on biological processes and indicators of ecosystems for integrating these indicators into watershed planning and management processes.

  title: 
  abstract: "Agriculture&rsquo;s contribution to radiative forcing is principally through its historical release of carbon in soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and through its contemporary release of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). The sequestration of soil carbon in soils now depleted in soil organic matter is a well-known strategy for mitigating the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere. Less well-recognized are other mitigation potentials. A full-cost accounting of the effects of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to quantify the relative importance of all mitigation options. Such an analysis shows nitrogen fertilizer, agricultural liming, fuel use, N2O emissions, and CH4 &#64258;uxes to have additional signi&#64257;cant potential for mitigation. By evaluating all sources in terms of their global warming potential it becomes possible to directly evaluate greenhouse policy options for agriculture. A comparison of temperate and tropical systems illustrates some of these options. "

The objective of this study was to analyze and quantify effects of management practices, topographical features, and weather conditions on spatial variability of crop yields. A one-factor randomized complete block design experiment with six replications was established at the Long Term Ecological Research site in southwest Michigan in 1988. The treatments used in this study were two treatments with conventional chemical inputs (chisel plow and no-till) and two organic-based chisel-plowed treatments with a winter leguminous cover crop (low chemical input and zero chemical input). The data consisted of corn (Zea mays L.)\x96soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]\x96wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields collected via combine monitors from 1996 to 2001. We observed that stressful conditions, regardless of the stress origin, were associated with increase in the overall yield variability (coefficient of variation) as well as the small-scale yield variability (variogram values at short lag distances and variogram slopes near the origin) with yields probably being more sensitive to the small-scale variations in growth conditions due to soil and microtopographical differences. Coefficients of variation were as high as 45% in years with low precipitation and as low as 14% in years with above-average precipitation. During the years with low precipitation, both the coefficients of variation and the small-scale variability were often significantly higher in the zero chemical input treatment than in the treatments that received fertilizer inputs. The coefficients of variation and the small-scale variability parameters also tended to be higher in corn stressed by antagonism from previous wheat crop in the no-till treatment."

  title: "SOM dynamics and C sink Capacity of Soil: Aforestation and Implications for Global Change"
  abstract: Disturbance to terestrial ecosystems as a consequence of agriculture, deforestation, and land degradation over the last century has resulted in a net los of soil C. Native forest soils contain 25 to 50% more C than asociated agricultural sites. Increased C storage capacity in aforested agricultural land has the potential to mitigate increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from anthropogenic sources. We evaluated C dynamics of aforested, native and agricultural areas of known history on similar soil types at the Fred Rus Forest managed by Kelog Biological Station (KBS), Newton Wods and asociated agricultural land in southern Michigan. A thre pol constrained model was utilized to examine turnover rates of soil C pols to determine whether soil C sequestration resulting from aforestation of agricultural lands can contribute to changes in global C cycles. Our results from Rus Forest show significant diferences in total C and N in the B horizon, and C horizon for the Aforested and Agricultural soils. Diferences in bulk density and horizon depth necesitate corections within treatments so that profiles are compared on the basis of equal soil weight. Total profile C and N corected for equal soil weight also difered significantly among aforested, agricultural, and native soils. Results from long-term incubations showed diferences in C dynamics among the thre land types. A two pol constrained model constructed using the rate curve from CO<sub>2</sub> evolution during incubations resulted in a larger C<sub>a</sub> pol in the top 20 cm of soil for the Agricultural soils (302 mg/kg soil-4.3 % of total C) than the Aforested soils (261 mg/kg soil-1.25 of total C).These results have a number of implications for global change. The Rus Forest has large quantities of C stored in biomas, liter and soils. The aforested biomas and soil curently contain an estimated 12 Mg C/ha and 7.6 Mg N/ha while the comparable agricultural sites contain 56 Mg C/ha and 5.4 Mg N/ha. This represents an increase in C storage in the aforested site of aproximately 6 Mg C/ha and 2.2 Mg N/ha since the forest was planted in the mid forties Aditionaly, aforested soils are sequestering soil C in pols with longer MRT&#146;s. Aditional studies on the efects of aforestation on C sequestration wil include sites from the KBS-Long Term Ecological Research Station poplar plots, deciduous and coniferous forest plots, and asociated agricultural plots.

    Nematode Community
    Analysis for Selected LTER Treatments
  abstract: |-
    Sampling has been conducted for two years from
    treatments eight, seven and a sub-treatment of seven, to establish
    a measurement system for the impact of disturbance upon nematode
    communities. Treatment eight is "traditionally not tilled" with
    approximately thirty years since disturbance. Treatment seven is
    "traditionally tilled" with approximately seven years since
    disturbance, at the beginning of our involvement. The sub-treatment
    within treatment seven was tilled at the start of this study. We
    refer to these treatments as 0, 7, and 30 years since disturbance.
    The sampling procedure calls for the same square meter to be
    sampled on each date, three times per year. Baerman pan extraction
    is used to draw nematodes from a soil sub-sample. The total
    nematodes collected from each sub-sample is counted, and 100
    individuals are randomly selected for identification to genus.
    These genera are classified according to life history and feeding
    site. Several indices of maturity, diversity and stability are
    applied to the resulting data. The three treatments are separated
    by differences in several measures including total number of
    nematodes, percent of plant, bacterial and fungal
    feeders.

  title: 
  abstract: "The aim of this paper is to clarify the effect of soil aggregation on physical and chemical properties of structured soils both on a bulk soil scale, for single aggregates, as well as for homogenized material. Aggregate formation and aggregate strength depend on swelling and shrinkage processes and on biological activity and kinds of organic exudates as well as on the intensity, number and time of swelling and drying events. Such aggregates are more dense than the bulk soil. The intra-aggregate pore distribution consists not only of finer pores, but these are also more tortuous. Therefore, water fluxes in aggregated soils are mostly multidimensional and the corresponding water fluxes in the intra-aggregate pore system are much smaller. Furthermore, ion transport both by mass flow and diffusion are delayed, whereby the length of the follow path in such tortuous finer pores further retards chemical exchange processes. The rearrangement of particles by aggregate formation also induces an increased apparent thermal diffusivity as compared with the homogenized material. The aggregate formation also affects the aeration and the gaseous composition in the intra-aggregate pore space. Depending on the kind and intensity of aggregation, the intra-aggregate pores can be completely anoxic, while the inter-aggregate pores are already completely aerated. The possibility to predict physical properties on these various scales depends on the rigidity of the pore system. In general, this rigidity depends on the above-mentioned physical and chemical processes both with respect to intensity and frequency. Thus, aggregates like subangular block or plates are the most rigid systems, while physical processes in the seedbed cannot be modelled using existing approaches due to the low strength and consequent instability of the pore system.

  title: Remote Sensing and Biophysical Variables of Crops
  abstract: "Field activities have ben planed as part of the research program at the Basic Science and Remote Sensing Initiative of Michigan State University to investigate the potential of remote sensing for estimation of biophysical variables of agricultural crops. These activities were also included in a research proposal submited to NASA to establish a long-term calibration site for EO-1 and its folow-on satelites. The EO-1 satelite wil cary thre sensors in the optical spectral region to colect both multi-spectral and hyperspectral data that are suitable for agricultural and environmental aplications. One of the major objectives of the proposed activities is to cary out a field study to colect ground-based radiometric and agronomic data coincident with EO-1 and Landsat 7 overpases in order to develop viable and practical means to convert EO-1 data into biophysical information. The proposed field study sites include a climatic gradient from arid Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, to temperate Michigan KBS, and to tropical <i>Las</i> <u><i>Alturas </i></u>Station, Costa Rica. At the KBS site, we plan to have the folowing activities:Continuous Monitoring:Continuous Monitoring: We wil set up a tower (<a href=\"Figures/qi_figure1.htm\">Figure 1</a>) at the LTER site to alow a continuous radiometric measurements of selected field plots in the same spectral bands as those on EO-1 satelites. On the tower, there wil be a Bowen Ratio device to measure the diurnal energy flux to monitor the consumptive water use. Besides these instruments, there wil be a pyronometer to record solar incoming radiation. The data set colected on this tower wil alow us to develop functional relationship betwen remotely sensed variables and crop biophysical properties.Snapshot Campaign: Snapshot Campaign: In adition to the measurements on the tower, there wil be field campaigns during the overpas of EO-1 and Landsat 7 satelites. The field campaign wil include yoke-based radiometric measurements along transects of diferent fields to cover a large area for direct comparison with EO-1 images. During each campaign, biophysical variables such as fractional gren vegetation cover, gren leaf area index, biomas, net primary production and chlorophyl content, wil be measured.Data Analysis:Data Analysis: Data from the field campaigns and the monitoring tower wil be analyzed to develop linkage betwen remotely sensed variable and biophysical parameters at plot or filed scale. Then the established relationship wil be aplied to satelite imagery to expand field results to large-scale aplications. These activities wil be initialy for thre years during the sumer growing season. The field measurements are expected to continue as part of our remote sensing and land use program at the Initiative. Therefore, these activities wil be a long-term research efort.

The process of developing generalities in ecology involves two approaches often not addressed in introductory science courses \x96 inductive and deductive. One way of thinking about this is to consider the inductive approach as examining particular cases and deriving general conclusions or rules from them, and the deductive approach as using generalities to make specific predictions that can then be tested. In this issue of Frontiers, Knapp et al. (pp 483\x9691) underline the need for general principles or \x93rules\x94 in ecology, and research that tests the predictive limits of those rules. The rules illustrated in this article are based on long-term studies from the Konza prairie and Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Existing data from savanna grasslands in South Africa are used to test rules derived from Konza studies of grassland responses to fire."

  abstract: "Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. The effects of defoliation on tree physiology are expected to cascade through the entire forest ecosystem, altering carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes, and subsequently affecting nitrogen cycling and plant-herbivore interactions. If these post-defoliation changes are largely driven by, N deficiency, tree root system responses to defoliation should be central to regulating the long-term effects of defoliation; N fertilization should reverse the effects. We examined these phenomena in a 3-year large-scale replicated manipulative field experiment in a hybrid poplar plantation, where we regulated defoliation by gypsy moths as well as nitrogen availability. To our knowledge, this is the first manipulative field experiment at this scale to examine the effects of severe insect defoliation on whole-tree physiology. Defoliation decreased tree growth and increased the rate of top dieback in the stand. Defoliation led to transient declines in carbon allocation to starch in fine roots, trunk, and twigs in the year of heaviest defoliation. Root production and root mortality were unaffected by the heaviest defoliation, but nitrate and ammonium uptake were strongly depressed. N fertilization increased tree growth, but did not alter defoliation effects on starch accumulation or top dieback. Defoliation and fertilization treatments did not interact. In this system, defoliation effects on tree recovery of leaf nitrogen lost to herbivory were primarily driven by effects on nitrogen uptake, rather than effects on root production or mortality. "

  title: Human Demensions of Long Term Ecological Change
  abstract: Complex interactions betwen demographic, economic, socio-cultural, and legal changes, and the environment have structured the history of Michigan&#146;s agricultural and natural resources. The increasing conflicts and debates over public and private control over the environment, its resources, and their development and management are outcomes of major changes in ecosystems and social systems. Throughout Michigan&#146;s history, shifting social trends interact with each other and with changes in landscape and land use, water quality, and fisheries and wildlife isues.Two hypotheses are explored:Changes in the social system in the KBS site area have had long term impacts on soil, land, water, and fisheries and wildlife management.North Central regional transformation proceses impact changes in the social dimensions and agricultural and natural resource ecosystem of the KBS LTER site.Using 1950 as a baseline, demographic data has ben gathered and compared acros decades to the present. This data forms the first part of a long-term data set on the KBS LTER site area. Data has ben obtained on eleven counties in Southwest Michigan and on the urbanized areas near KBS. This data colection is nearing completion and an analysis of the import of this data for charting social systemic change is in progres. Initial indications are that the many of the changes are folowing paterns of demographic and socio-economic change at the national level, e.g., increased heterogeneity; migration reflecting increased presence of ex-urbanites in rural areas; expansion, contraction, and displacement in the labor force as outcome of economic cycles and restructuring.In the Fal, data colection on the structure of agriculture for five decades wil begin. It is expected that we wil complete that data set by the end of December. Next, data on natural resources (fisheries, wildlife, forestry, etc.) wil be gathered. We wil also identify key points of integration betwen biophysical and social system. Subsequently, we wil begin to examine regional level proceses impacting on the ecosystem.

    Delineation of
    an Ecologically Based Structure of Agricultural Production in the
    Corn Belt
  abstract: |-
    A thorough analysis of the spatial and temporal
    dynamics of crop productivity in an eco-regional context at various
    hierarchical levels may reveal the ecologically based structure of
    an agricultural production system. This would facilitate the
    development of ecologically based management systems for
    agriculture. Our long-term goal will be to assess the long-term
    viability of agricultural systems at a regional scale by reducing
    the impact of agricultural practices on natural systems. We expect
    that this analysis will set the stage to begin the development of a
    model to forecast regional crop productivity in the next century.
    This model would integrate physical, ecological, socio-economic,
    and management systems.Our first step will be to evaluate the spatial
    scale at which the physical system (climate and geomorphology)
    influence or determine crop productivity patterns in the North
    Central Region. Crop yield characterization will be conducted at
    different spatial scales over a period of 20 years. We will then
    assess the effect of climatic fluctuations on crop yield at each
    scale within an eco-regional hierarchy. In addition we will assess
    which regional scheme and which scale best explains patterns of
    crop yield in the North Central Region. Using analytical spatial
    technologies, we will generate spatial gradients of crop yields
    that will be compared against the different scales of ecoregion
    classification schemes. Major outcomes of this project will be a)
    the development of procedures and protocols for an ecoregion-based
    geospatial analysis of agricultural system performance, b) a scale
    analysis of crop productivity in the Corn Belt over a 25 year
    period, under agrobased and ecobased regions and c) an assessment
    of how ecobased regions can facilitate the development of
    ecologically based agricultural systems in the Corn
    Belt.

  title: 
  abstract: "Tillage generally reduces aggregation and particulate organic matter (POM) content. We hypothesized that reduced C sequestration in conventional tillage (CT) compared with no-tillage (NT) is related to differences in aggregate turnover. Four soils (Haplustoll, Fragiudalf, Hapludalf, and Paleudalf), each with NT, CT, and native vegetation (NV) treatments, were separated into aggregates. Free light fraction (LF) and intraaggregate POM (iPOM) were isolated. At one site we used C-13 natural abundance to differentiate crop- and grassland-derived C. Concentrations of coarse iPOM C (250-2000 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates), expressed on a per unit aggregate weight (g iPOM C kg(-1) aggregate), did not differ between tillage treatments. In contrast, concentrations of fine iPOM C (53-250 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates) were less in CT compared to NT macroaggregates, On a whole soil basis, fine iPOM C was on average 51% less in CT than in NT, and accounted for 21% of the total C difference between NT and CT. The concentration of free LF C was not affected by tillage, but was on average 45% less in the cultivated systems than NV. Proportions of crop-derived C in macroaggregates were similar in NT and CT, but were three times greater in microaggregates from NT than microaggregates from CT. We suggest that a faster turnover rate of macroaggregates in CT compared with NT leads to a slower rate of microaggregate formation within macroaggregates and less stabilization of new SOM in free microaggregates under CT.

  title: Basidiomycetes in Select KBS Soils
  abstract: "Soil fungi represent the richest species diversity and largest total biomas of al soil microbiota. One subgroup, the basidiomycetes, produce enzymes involved in the degradation of lignin and humics and are responsible for the majority of the degradation of lignocelulose plant residues and soil organic mater. Very litle is known about their phylogenetic diversity and how this diversity afects ecosystem function. We have studied the ocurance of soil basidiomycetes and the diversity of their lignin degrading capabilities on thre levels: 1) The ocurance of sporocarps as a measure of species richnes; 2) The isolation of unique soil basidiomycetes as a measure of species richnes with concurent analysis of the lignin modifying enzymes they produce and; 3) the isolation of basidiomycete DNA from total soil comunity DNA with the subsequent analyses for both species richnes (using 25S rDNA) and the encodement of lignin modifying genes.The first level of our study has resulted in the folowing basidiomycete species list for KBS:Note that when there are repeats (such as Mycena species) each species is unique.The second level of our study has revealed that as we go from a no-til to a tiled treatment, species richnes decreases with a concurent increase in the ocurence and distribution of lignin modifying enzymes. As we go from a treatment with a lower diversity of plant material inputs (mainly lower heterogeneity) to a treatment with a higher diversity of plant material we se both higher species richnes and ocurence of lignin modifying enzymes.The third level of our study is curently underway. Results are to preliminary to make any firm conclusions at this time."

  title: 
  abstract: A major challenge in microbial ecology is to develop reliable and facile methods of computer-assisted microscopy that can analyze digital images of complex microbial communities at single cell resolution, and compute useful quantitative characteristics of their organization and structure without cultivation. Here we describe a computer-aided interactive system to analyze the high degree of morphological diversity in growing microbial communities revealed by phase-contrast microscopy. The system, called "CMEIAS" (Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System) consists of several custom plug-ins for UTHSCSA ImageTool, a free downloadable image analysis program operating on a personal computer in a Windows NT environment. CMEIAS uses various measurement features and two object classifiers to extract size and shape measurements of segmented, digital images of microorganisms and classify them into their appropriate morphotype. The first object classifier uses a single measurement feature to analyze relatively simple communities containing only a few morphotypes (e.g., regular rods, cocci, filaments). A second new hierarchical tree classifier uses an optimized subset of multiple measurement features to analyze significantly more complex communities containing greater morphological diversity than ever before possible. This CMEIAS shape classifier automatically categorizes each cell into one of 11 predominant bacterial morphotypes, including cocci, spirals, curved rods, U-shaped rods, regular straight rods, unbranched filaments, ellipsoids, clubs, rods with extended prostheca, rudimentary branched rods, and branched filaments. The training and testing images for development and evaluation of the CMEIAS classifier were obtained from 1,937 phase-contrast grayscale digital images of various diverse communities. The CMEIAS shape classifier had an accuracy of 96.0% on a training set of 1,471 cells and 97.0% on a test set of 4,270 cells representing all 11 bacterial morphotype classes, indicating that accurate classification of rich morphological diversity in microbial communities is now possible. An interactive edit feature was added to address the main sources of error in automatic shape classification, enabling the operator to inspect the assigned morphotype of each bacterium based on visual recognition of its distinctive pseudocolor, reassign it to another morphotype class if necessary, and add up to five other morphotypes to the classification scheme. The shape classifier reports on the number and types of different morphotypes present and the abundance among each of them, thus providing the data needed to compute the morphological diversity within the microbial community. An example of how CMEIAS can augment the analysis of microbial community structure is illustrated by studies of morphological diversity as an indicator of dynamic ecological succession following a nutrient shift-up perturbation in two continuously fed, anaerobic bioreactors with morphologically distinct start communities. Various steps to minimize the limitations of computer-assisted microscopy to classify bacterial morphotypes using CMEIAS are described. In summary, CMEIAS is an accurate, robust, flexible semiautomatic computing tool that can significantly enhance the ability to quantitate bacterial morphotype diversity and should serve as a useful adjunct to the analysis of microbial community structure. This first version of CMEIAS will be released as free, downloadable plug-ins so it can provide wide application in studies of microbial ecology.

    Relationship Between
    Nematode Community Structure and Soil Quality
  abstract: |-
    &nbsp;Four research sites were
    used in research designed to develop a nematode community
    assessment protocol for assessment of soil quality. The research
    locations included the Long-Term Ecological Research and the Living
    Field Laboratory sites at the Kellogg Biological Research Sation in
    Hickory Corners, Michigan, the Long-Term Potato Production Systems
    site at the Montcalm Potato Research Farm in Entrican, Michigan,
    and the Cherry Groundcover research site at Cherry Bay Orchards in
    Lelanau County, Michigan. This abstract summarizes the results from
    each of these research locations.Approximately 75 different
    taxa of nematodes were encountered during the research. They
    include herbivores, bacterivores, fungivores, algavores, carnivores
    and omnivores. Early-season nematode population densities in the
    Long-Range Ecological Research Site in 1996, ranged from 544 to 952
    nematodes per 100 cm3. Various ecological parameters
    were used to analyze the data, including the maturity index and
    plant parasitic nematode index described in the nematode ecology
    literature. Only simple trophic group ratios, however, will be
    included in this abstract.Long-Term Ecological
    Research Site.- Nematode community structure was monitored
    in three different soil ecosystems associated with old-field
    secondary succession differentiated by the number of years since
    soil disturbance. Early in the growing season, old-field sites that
    had not been disturbed for 30 years had significantly greater
    bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode and bacterial
    feeding nematode/plant parasite nematode ratios than those
    associated with the sites disturbed at the beginning of the LTER in
    1988. A similar comparative response was observed for the
    disturbance sites initiated in 1995, at the beginning the project.
    The results from this research will serve as a basis for the
    understanding of nematode recolonization of soil ecosystems
    following soil disturbance. This is extremely important because of
    the vast array of soil disturbance associated with most current
    systems of conventional agriculture.Living Field Laboratory
    Research Site.- During the early part of the growing season,
    the bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode and
    non-plant parasite/plant parasite ratios associated with continuous
    corn were greater in the transition organic than in the
    conventional, integrated fertilizer and integrated compost farming
    systems. When nematode community structure was analyzed for the
    soybean-corn-wheat rotation system, however, the highest early
    season bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode ratio and
    non-plant parasite nematode/plant parasite ration was highest for
    the integrated fertilizer system. Because of the temporal nature of
    the fungal and bacterial biomass in soils, it will probably be
    necessary to take nematode samples for community structure analysis
    at weekly intervals to determine the best timeor sampling in relation to
    prediction of nematode community structure.Long-Term Potato
    Production System Research Site.- The early-season bacterial
    feeding nematode /plant parasitic nematode ratios were similar for
    a system of continuous potatoes grown under conventional practices
    and an alternative system using composted buckwheat as the rotation
    crop. At the end of the growing season, however, there was a
    25-fold difference between these two nematode feeding type ratios
    between these two potato production systems. The nematode community
    structure ratio with the greatest number of bacterial feeders was
    associated with the alternative management system and the greatest
    number of plant parasites was associated with the conventional
    system.Cherry Groundcover
    Systems Research.- At the end of the growing season, the
    bacterial feeding nematode/plant parasitic nematode ratio was 4.2
    for a conventional cherry production system including mulch;
    whereas, the same ratio was 89.3 for a transition organic system
    managed by a professional organic farming consultant.Conclusions.-
    Although it has not been possible to develop a comprehensive
    nematode community structure protocol for assessment of soil
    quality during the short time-frame associated with this project:
    it was possible, however, to form the following three
    conclusions.- Alternative cherry and
    potato farming systems significantly alter nematode community
    structure.- While none of the Living
    Field Laboratory farming systems at the Kellogg Biological Station
    had nematode community structures similar to that of the Long-Term
    Ecological Research 30-year-old field succession site, it was
    possible to use nematode community structure to differentiate among
    farming systems.- Although nematode
    community structure is temporal and site-specific, the research
    associated with this project indicates that it has good potential
    for use in future evaluations of soil quality. It is estimated that
    about five more years of research data will be necessary to
    develop, test and validate appropriate soil quality analysis
    protocols.

  title: 
  abstract: "Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the I:ate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT.

  abstract: "Relying more on biological N2 fixation has been suggested as a way to meet one of the major challenges of agricultural sustainability. A N-15 study was conducted to compare the fate of applied legume and fertilizer N in a long-term cropping systems experiment. Nitrogen-15-labeled red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and (NH4)2SO4 were applied to microplots within the low-input and conventional cropping systems of the Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research Center in Pennsylvania. The N-15 was applied to soil and traced into corn (Zea mays L.) in 1987 and 1988. Residual N-15 was also traced into second-year spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Legume and fertilizer N-15 remaining in soil was measured and loss of N was calculated by difference. More fertilizer than legume N was recovered by crops (40 vs. 17% of input), more legume than fertilizer N was retained in soil (47 vs. 17% of input), and similar amounts of N from both sources were lost from the cropping systems (39% of input) over the 2-yr period. More fertilizer than legume N was lost during the year of application (38 vs. 18% of input), but more legume than fertilizer N was lost the year after application (17 vs. 4% of input). Residual fertilizer and legume N-15 was distributed similarly among soil fractions. Soil microbial biomass was larger in the legume-based system. A larger, but not necessarily more active, soil microbial biomass was probably responsible for the greater soil N supplying capacity in the legume-based compared with fertilizer-based system. "

  abstract: "Soil aggregate distribution and stability measurements have been proposed as soil quality indicators. However, pretreatment of soil, antecedent water content and differences in sand size distribution among soils can confound interpretation of these measurements. We propose a normalized stability index (NSI) which (i) compares aggregate distribution after slaking and rewetting to characterize whole soil stability and eliminate confounding effects of pretreatment and antecedent water content, (ii) corrects for the confounding effect of differences in sand size distribution among soils, aggregate size classes and pretreatments, and (iii) normalizes the level of disruption imposed by slaking by using a maximum level of disruption. The NSI was tested on three soils dominated by a 2:1 clay mineralogy and one soil characterized by a mixed (2:1 and 1:1) clay mineralogy. Each site had native vegetation (NV), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT) treatments. In soils dominated by 2:1 clays, NSI decreased with increasing cultivation intensity (NV &gt; NT &gt; CT). However, NSI was higher in the soil with mixed clays compared to the other soils and was not different along the cultivation gradient. These observations are hypothesized to be related to the presence of Fe- and Al-oxides and kaolinite. In conclusion, NSI appears to be a good indicator for soil structural quality since it is sensitive to changes in agricultural practices and it minimizes confounding effects. A decrease of SOM levels results in a smaller decrease of soil stability in soils dominated by oxides and 1:1 minerals compared to soils dominated by 2:1 minerals. "

  abstract: "Measurements of the average growth rates of soil bacteria from a soil under three treatments; a conventional high input corn soybean rotation, a reversion to a native successional community (4 years) and a never ploughed grassland, were made by two methods. The specific rates of synthesis of bacterial DNA were determined from the specific activities of the DNA precursor, deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and purified bacterial community DNA after 3H thymidine incorporation. These rates were compared with the specific respiration rates of the soil microbiota determined from the initial rate of C mineralization and the microbial biomass C. We show how these two measurements can be used to estimate values for microbial growth yield and maintenance coefficients in soil. Both methods ranked the soil treatments in the same order. The reversion treatment had the highest thymidine incorporation and specific respiration rates and the corn soybean rotation the lowest. The grassland soil had the highest microbial biomass but an intermediate growth rate. Based on thymidine incorporation the doubling time of the bacterial biomass at 25&deg;C was 160 days in soil from the corn soybean rotation and 107 days in the reversion treatment. Fractionation of the 3H-labelled DNA according to its %guanine+cytosine content showed growth of soil bacteria to be widespread among bacterial genera and not confined to a few active species. The soil bacterial growth rates found inre are much lower than those found in some other studies using thymidine incorporation but are in agreement with annual C budgets for the soils. "

  title: 
  abstract: Several lines of evidence suggest that nitrogen in most tropical forests is relatively more available than N in most temperate forests, and even that it may function as an excess nutrient in many tropical forests. If this is correct, tropical forests should have more open N cycles than temperate forests, with both inputs and outputs of N large relative to N cycling within systems. Consequent differences in both the magnitude and the pathways of N loss imply that tropical forests should in general be more15N enriched than are most temperate forests. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of tree leaves and soils from a variety of tropical and temperate forests. Foliar 15N values from tropical forests averaged 6.5 higher than from temperate forests. Within the tropics, ecosystems with relatively low N availability (montane forests, forests on sandy soils) were significantly more depleted in15N than other tropical forests. The average 15N values for tropical forest soils, either for surface or for depth samples, were almost 8 higher than temperate forest soils. These results provide another line of evidence that N is relatively abundant in many tropical forest ecosystems.

  title: 
  abstract: "Identifying 'functional' pools of soil organic matter and understanding their response to tillage remains elusive. We have studied the effect of tillage on the enriched labile fraction, thought to derive from microbes and having an intermediate turnover time. Four soils, each under three regimes, long-term arable use without tillage (NT), long-term arable under conventional tillage (CT), and native vegetation (NV), were separated into four aggregate size classes. Particle size fractions of macro- (250-2000 mu m) and microaggregates (53-250 mu m) were isolated by sonication and sieving. Subsequently, densiometric and chemical analyses were made on fine-silt-sized (2-20 mu m) particles to isolate and identify the enriched labile fraction. Across soils, the amounts of C and N in the particle size fractions were highly variable and were strongly influenced by mineralogy, specifically by the contents of Fe and Al oxides. This evidence indicates that the fractionation procedure cannot be standardized across soils. In one soil, C associated with fine-silt-sized particles derived from macroaggregates was 567 g C m(-2) under NV, 541 g C m(-2) under NT, and 135 g C m(-2) under CT, whereas C associated with fine-silt-sized particles derived from microaggregates was 552, 1018, 1302 g C m(-2) in NV, NT and CT, respectively. These and other data indicate that carbon associated with fine-silt-sized particles is not significantly affected by tillage. Its location is simply shifted from macroaggregates to microaggregates with increasing tillage intensity. Natural abundance C-13 analyses indicated that the enriched labile fraction was the oldest fraction isolated from both macro- and microaggregates. We conclude that the enriched labile fraction is a 'passive' pool of soil organic matter in the soil and is not derived from microbes nor sensitive to cultivation. "

  abstract: "We examined the effects of plant age and root age on mycorrhizal colonization in the obligate mycotrophic grass Andropogon gerardii grown at high and low rates of soil phosphorus availability. There were significant interactions between soil P availability, plant age: root age and mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization of 1-week-old roots increased with plant age, but was not significantly affected by soil P availability. Colonization of roots increased significantly with increasing root age only in the low-P treatment. Although the high-P treatment increased rates of root extension for some root age classes, there were not consistently lower rates of colonization in these roots. Studies of P acquisition by A. gerardii and other mycotrophic plants should take these interacting factors into account, especially when examining exploitation of nutrient-enriched patches.

  title: 
  abstract: "The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53-250 mum sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.

  title: 
  abstract: "Chloroform fumigation-incubation (CPI) has made possible the extensive characterization of soil microbial biomass carbon (C) (MBC). Defining the non-microbial C mineralized in soils following fumigation remains the major limitation of CFI. The mineralization of non-microbial C during CFI was examined by adding C-14-maize to soil before incubation. The decomposition of the C-14-maize during a 10-d incubation after fumigation was 22.5% that in non-fumigated control soils. Re-inoculation of the fumigated soil raised C-14-maize decomposition to 73% that of the unfumigated control. A method was developed which varies the proportion of mineralized C from the unfumigated soil (UFC) that is subtracted in calculating CFI biomasss C. The proportion subtracted (P) varies according to a linear function of the ratio of C mineralized in the fumigated (F-C) and unfumigated samples (F-C/UFC) with two parameters K-1 and K-2 (P = K-1 F-C/UFC) + K-2). These parameters were estimated by regression of CFI biomass C, calculated according to the equation MBC = (F-C - PUFC)/0.41, against that derived by direct microscopy in a series of California soils. Parameter values which gave the best estimate of microscopic biomass from the fumigation data were K-1 = 0.29 and K-2 = 0.23 (R(2) = 0.87). Substituting these parameter values, the equation can be simplified to MBC = 1.73 F-C - 0.56UF(C). The equation was applied to other CFI data to determine its effect on the measurement of MBC. The use of this approach corrected data that were previously difficult to interpret and helped to reveal temporal trends and changes in MBC associated with soil depth. "

  abstract: "A field study was conducted to determine if earthworm activity would affect the abundance and composition of weed seed banks in annual row-crops. The abundance of weed seeds in surface-deposited earthworm casts was determined in continuous monocultures and rotations that included corn, soybean, and winter wheat, with or without cover crop. Casts were collected weekly over the growing season and the weed seed content determined by direct germination in a heated greenhouse. Weed seed composition in surface casts was compared to that in the seed bank (0-5 cm) and soil surface by the same method. Earthworm cast production varied temporally and among crops and was higher in winter wheat compared to corn or soybean. The effect of crop rotation on cast production was significant only in soybean, with the highest production in monocultures compared to three-crop rotations. Weed seed densities were significantly higher in casts collected from winter wheat than corn or soybean. Comparisons of the composition and relative abundance of seeds in earthworm casts with the surface soil layer and seed batik suggest that earthworms contribute to redistribution of weed seeds over the growing season.

The objective of this study was to develop a method of labeling the roots of Populus trees with N-15 without physically disturbing the soil. Such a method would enable the direct measurement of the flux of N-15 from dead roots into the soil organic matter. Leaf and root biomass were labeled by injection of N-15 directly into the vessel elements of hybrid Populus trees during their second growing season. The N-15 was uniformly distributed throughout the canopy and root system. The rate and amount of N-15 turnover from plant tissue can be determined by pool transfer or through differences in plant N-15 concentrations. The N-15 was detected in the dead-root pool 8 wk after injection, indicating root turnover. Results demonstrate the ability to measure the contribution of fine-root litter to N-cycling processes without disturbing the soil environment. "

  abstract: "The effects of crop rotation and management system on annual variability in weed communities and crop yields were assessed in a 4-yr study in Michigan. Variability of the weed community and corn yields were assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and a multivariate dissimilarity index (Bray-Curtis) that accounted for changes in both weed species abundance and composition. The treatments included two rotations: continuous corn and a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation, and two management systems: conventional (CONV) and organic-based (ORG). Weed biomass was significantly higher in the ORG system; however, there was no effect of crop rotation on weed biomass or number of weed species in a treatment (species richness). Annual variability in weed community composition and structure was affected by both crop rotation and management system and was highest in the ORG rotation. In contrast to the weed community, variability in corn yield was highest in the least-diverse cropping system (CONV monoculture), despite that system having a more constant weed community. Corn yield in the ORG rotation was not significantly different from that in the CONV monoculture. Results of this study suggest that management aimed at increasing cropping system diversity may have additional effects on weed communities and crop yields beyond those commonly reported, and these may have important implications for the development of more efficient and sustainable weed and crop management practices.

  abstract: "We studied whole-tree C allocation with special emphasis on the quantification of C allocations to roots and root respiration. To document seasonal patterns of C allocation, 2-year-old hybrid poplar trees greater than 3 m tall were labeled with CO(2)C-14 in a large Plexiglas chamber in the field, in July and September. Climate and CO2 concentration were controlled to track ambient conditions during labeling. Individual tree canopy CO2 assimilation averaged 3.8 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 (12.9 g C day-1 tree-1) in July and 6.2 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 (9.8 g C day-1 tree-1) in September. Aboveground dark respiration was 12% of net daytime C fixation in July and 15% in September. Specific activity of root-soil respiration peaked 2 days after labeling and stabilized to less than 5% of maximum 2 weeks later. Low specific activity of root-soil respiration and a labeled pool of root C demonstrated that current photosynthate was the primary source of C for root growth and maintenance during the growing season. Root respiration averaged 20% of total soil respiration in both July and September based on the proportion of labeled C respired to labeled C fixed. In July, 80% of the recovered C-14 was found above ground and closely resembled the weight distribution of the growing shoot. By September, 51% of the recovered C-14 was in the root system and closely resembled the weight distribution of different size classes of roots. The finding that the distribution of biomass and C-14 were similar verified that the C introduced during labeling followed normal seasonal translocation pathways. Results are compared to smaller scale labeling studies and the suitability of the approach for studying long-term C fluxes is discussed. "

  title: 
  abstract: "1 We examined the impact of nitrogen addition on early successional dynamics and plant species diversity in replicate plots of an old-field succession treatment in south-western Michigan, USA, for 7 years following abandonment from agriculture.  2 Nitrogen addition significantly increased above-ground plant biomass, but had no effect on the displacement or persistence of different life-history groups. Annual species made up a similar proportion of community biomass and decreased at equivalent rates in control and nitrogen-addition microplots. Perennial species biomass increased at similar rates in the control and nitrogen-addition microplots. 3 Annual species dominated initially, but declined in abundance over the first 4 years and were replaced by biennials and then herbaceous perennials. The resulting high numbers of species losses and gains were not affected by nitrogen addition. 4 Nitrogen addition did not affect mean species density or the Shannon index of diversity. There was also no temporal change in the similarity of species composition between control and nitrogen-addition microplots, indicating that nitrogen addition did not cause divergence over time in community composition. In year 7, similar species dominated the nitrogen-addition and control microplots, but there were differences in species composition and abundance of the subordinate species in each community. 5 Only in year 6 of this study was there a significant negative relationship between community biomass and the Shannon diversity index. There was no significant relationship between community biomass and species density in any of the first 7 years following abandonment. Thus, the community response to increased biomass due to nitrogen addition was expressed primarily through changes in community structure, not richness. 6 The effects of nitrogen addition on the early successional dynamics, species composition and consequently diversity of a plant community may depend on initial site conditions. The response to nitrogen enrichment may be slower in sites such as ours with fertile soils that become dominated by herbaceous perennial dicots. "

  abstract: "Water absorption is influenced by the geometric distribution of viable roots and the availability of water at root surfaces. Utilization of additional plant energy for the extensive and localized development of root systems is a high risk investment of carbon by the plant, especially during short-term water deficits. Nonuniform root distribution, resulting from root growth within networks of continuous soil macropores, reduces the efficiency of water absorption by minimizing contact between roots and increasing the geometric mean pathway of water from the bulk soil to the root. Root clustering in these soil niches causes greater intraspecific competition for the limited water, especially as soil water deficits develop more deeply within the soil profile. Current methods for quantifying and predicting plant root and soil water relationships are reviewed, and some research and modeling imperatives are presented. "

  title: 
  abstract: "The ability to predict leaf appearance would enhance our capability of modeling plant development and the rate of leaf area expansion. Many crop models use the constant thermal time for successive leaf tip appearance (which is often termed a phyllochron) as one model parameter to predict total number of leaves and date of anthesis. However, many researchers have found that phyllochron is not constant, but is dependent upon environment. The problem could be related to the simplified assumption that the daily leaf appearance rate is linearly related to temperature (and hence, phyllochron is constant, independent of temperature). In reality, the temperature response function for the development of a biological system is nonlinear. Thus, we fitted daily leaf appearance rate-temperature relationships obtained from growth room studies for both wheat (Triticum aestivum) and corn (Zea mays L.) to a nonlinear beta function with 0 degrees C as the base temperature and 42 degrees C as the upper critical temperature. The function described the relationships very well over the full range of temperatures for plant development. Other variables that are used to describe the duration and rate of leaf appearance, such as calendar days, phyllochron, and thermal rate of leaf appearance, are related to the daily leaf appearance rate, eliminating the need to develop various mathematical functions to independently describe the response of these variables to temperature. Because of the nonlinear nature of the temperature response function, we demonstrated that more accurate determinations of daily leaf appearance rates can be achieved by calculating rates over relatively short periods (i.e., hourly) and summing these to get the mean daily rate. Many environmental factors other than temperature also affect leaf appearance rate. However, once the proper temperature response function for leaf appearance rate is determined, it is much easier to determine when and how other factors are involved to modify the leaf appearance rate under a given environment.

  abstract: "The classification of agricultural tillage systems has proven challenging in the past using traditional classification methods due to the similarity of spectral reflectance signatures of soils and senescent crop residues. In this study, five classification methods were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) cropping methods: minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance, Maximum Likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and the cosine of the angle concept (CAC). A Landsat ETM+ image acquired over southern Michigan and northern Indiana was used to test these classification methods. Each classification method was validated with 293 ground truth sampling locations collected commensurate with the satellite overpass. Classification accuracy was then assessed using error matrix analysis, Kappa statistics, and tests for statistical significance. The results indicate that of the classification routines examined, the two spectral angle methods were superior to the others. The cosine of the angle concept algorithm outperformed all the other classification routines for tillage practice identification and mapping, yielding an overall accuracy of 97.2% (Kappa = 0.959).

  title: 
  abstract: "1. In the mid-1970s, Hynes (1975) wrote eloquently about the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial systems. Central theories in stream ecology developed thereafter have dealt with the longitudinal flow of energy, materials and organisms in streams, and, with the exception of the flood pulse concept (Junk, Bayley &amp; Sparks, 1989), have largely ignored areas outside the riparian zone. The structure of the upland and activities occurring there play a more important part than previously recognized in regulating community structure and ecosystem processes in streams.  2. These new perspectives are made possible by developments in hierarchy theory, patch dynamics, and the refinement of tools used to quantify spatial and temporal heterogeneity. 3. Geographical information systems (GIS), image processing technology and spatial statistical techniques allow quantitative assessment of lateral, longitudinal and vertical components of the landscape that interact at several spatial and temporal scales to influence streams. When GIS is used in concert with geostatistics, multivariate statistics, or landscape models, complex relationships can be elucidated and predicted. 4. To a certain extent, the tools discussed above have only automated functions that were previously performed manually. This suite of tools has improved the ability of aquatic ecologists to examine relationships and test theories over larger, more heterogeneous regions than were previously possible. 5. At the local, state and federal level, management and regulatory frameworks are currently being re-evaluated to incorporate this new perspective in resource management and policy decision making. 6. We will discuss current and future trends in technologies and tools used for aquatic ecosystem research, and the use of techniques as they are applied in these regional assessments are also discussed.

By 1995, the third year of the rotation, rotation as well as cover crop influenced the rate of N mineralization at PSNT sampling Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) residue following wheat provided both the earliest and highest amount of mineralization, and the highest yield for a succeeding corn crop.

  abstract: "Soil microbial communities are integrally involved in biogeochemical cycles and their activities are crucial to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the importance of soil microorganisms, little is known about the distribution of microorganisms in the soil or the manner in which microbial community structure responds to changes in land management. We investigated the structure of microbial communities in the soil over two years in a series of replicated plots, that included, cultivated fields, fields abandoned from cultivation and fields with no history of cultivation. Microbial community structure was examined by monitoring the relative abundance of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from seven of the most common bacterial groups in soil (the Alpha and Beta Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cytophagales, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and the Acidobacteria) and the Eukarya. These data reveal that soil microbial communities are dynamic, capable of significant change at temporal scales relative to seasonal events. However, despite temporal change in microbial community structure, the rRNA relative abundance of particular microbial groups is affected by the local environment such that recognizable patterns of community structure exist in relation to field management.

  title: 
  abstract: "Analysis of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles extracted from soils is a rapid and inexpensive procedure that holds great promise in describing soil microbial community structure without traditional reliance on selective culturing, which seems to severely underestimate community diversity. Interpretation of FAME profiles from environmental samples can be difficult because many fatty acids are common to different microorganisms and many fatty acids are extracted from each soil sample. We used principal components (PCA) and cluster analyses to identify similarities and differences among soil microbial communities described using FAME profiles. We also used PCA to identify particular FAMEs that characterized soil sample clusters. Fatty acids that are found only or primarily in particular microbial taxa - marker fatty acids - were used in conjunction with these analyses. We found that the majority of 162 soil samples taken from a conventionally-tilled corn field had similar FAME profiles but that about 20% of samples seemed to have relatively low, and that about 10% had relatively high, bacterial:fungal ratios. Using semivariance analysis we identified 21:0 iso as a new marker fatty acid. Concurrent use of geostatistical and FAME analyses may be a powerful means of revealing other potential marker FAMEs. When microbial communities from the same samples were cultured on R2A agar and their FAME profiles analyzed, there were many differences between FAME profiles of soil and plated communities, indicating that profiles of FAMEs extracted from soil reveal portions of the microbial community not culturable on R2A. When subjected to PCA, however, a small number of plated communities were found to be distinct due to some of the same profile characteristics (high in 12:0 iso, 15:0 and 17:1 ante A) that identified soil community FAME profiles as distinct. Semivariance analysis indicated that spatial distributions of soil microbial populations are maintained in a portion of the microbial community that is selected on laboratory media. These similarities between whole soil and plated community FAME profiles suggest that plated communities are not solely the result of selection by the growth medium, but reflect the distribution, in situ, of the dominant, culturable soil microbial populations.

  title: 
  abstract: "The ecosystem consequences of microbial diversity are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity influences ecosystem function by quantifying denitrification enzyme activity among denitrifying bacteria isolated from two geomorphically similar soils with significantly different in situ nitrous oxide (N2O) emission rates. We sampled soil from two southwest Michigan sites on the same soil series that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime - a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field. We isolated denitrifying bacteria from these soils, characterized them based on their fatty acid profiles, and compared denitrifier community composition for the two fields. For 31 representative isolates, we measured the sensitivity of nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) - which catalyzes the reduction of N2O to N-2 - to low oxygen concentrations. Of the 93 denitrifying bacteria isolated from the agricultural held and 63 from the successional field, fatty acid profiles suggested the presence of 27 denitrifying taxa with only 12 common to both soils. In each field type the four numerically dominant taxa were either rare or absent in the other field. In addition, we found substantial diversity in the sensitivity of isolate Nos enzymes to oxygen, indicating that the taxonomic diversity present among denitrifiers in these two soils is functionally significant. These results demonstrate a clear physiological basis for differences in denitrifier community function previously described (Cavigelli and Robertson, 2000. The functional significance of denitrifier community composition in a terrestrial ecosystem. Ecology 81, 229-241.) and indicate that differences in denitrifier community composition alone can potentially influence in situ N2O production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. "

    Weed Seed Bank Dynamics at the LTER (Long Term Ecological
    Research) Agroecosystem Site
  abstract: |-
    The weed seed bank in agroecosystems is the
    primary source of weed infestations each year. Tillage, crop
    rotation, and herbicide use influence the persistence, vertical
    distribution, species composition, and abundance of seeds in the
    weed seed bank. The seed bank at the LTER agroecosystem site was
    measured at site initiation in 1988 and then measured in 1990,
    1993, and 1996 in each of the seven cropping systems imposed in
    1989. In 1988 there was an average of 1873 seeds m-2 ,
    with common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and fall
    panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum Michx.) the co-dominant
    weed species in the seed bank. By 1990 the distribution and number
    of weed seeds was dependent on cropping system. The mean number of
    weed seeds m-2 was 67340 in the successional treatment,
    23470 in alfalfa, and 5000 seeds m-2 or less in the
    other five cropping systems that included a corn-soybean rotation
    in no-tillage and conventional tillage with herbicide inputs, a
    corn-soybean-wheat rotation with low or no chemical inputs, and in
    Populus trees. From 1990 to 1996 the weed seed bank
    decreased in the successional community, and remained below 2000
    seeds m-2 in Populus. The number of annual
    grass seeds in the alfalfa treatment was greatest the year
    following alfalfa seeding. Common lambsquarters and annual grass
    seeds increased in the conventional tillage and no-tillage
    corn-soybean rotation from 1990 to 1996 but the total weed seed
    bank in these two systems was less than the total seed bank in the
    low input system. Common lambsquarters and common chickweed
    (Stellaria media (L.) Vill.) were the co-dominant weed
    species in the seed bank in the low and no chemical input
    systems.

  abstract: We studied the 9-yr (1986-1994) statewide gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), population distribution dynamics in Michigan using geographic information systems (GIS) based on an analysis of pheromone trap data of male moth catch from more than 3,000 permanent sites. A time series of male moth contour maps with 7 density categories (0, 1-25, 26-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400 and >400 moths . trap(-1) . year(-1)) was created using the GIS. The statewide gypsy moth population expanded at an alarming rate of 6,053 km(2)/yr with the largest area infested being 128,164 km(2) (85% of the state) in 1993. The population-weighted mean center staved in the Lower Peninsula, but a low density population was developing in the Upper Peninsula during the 9-yr period. Map analysis showed that the statewide population gradually increased from 1986 to 1990 and then became relatively stable thereafter. Both the highest weighted average density (191 moths.trap 1 . year(-1)) and the greatest coefficient of relative dispersion ( 307%) occurred in 1990. Linear regression slopes between successive) ears were >1.0 before 1990 and <1.0 thereafter, indicating an increasing and then decreasing population density change. Regression results between successive years indicate that the previous years' population map is a good linear approximation for the following (r(2) >70%). In the 9-yr study, 55% of the population cells staved in the same density class in the following year. A general pattern of population density shifts was that increase prevailed over decrease. Research methodology, population distribution, temporal dynamics, and density shifts are discussed.

  abstract: "Culture-based methods for enumeration, such as most probable number (MPN) methodologies, have proved inefficient due to difficulties in the isolation and cultivation of ammonia oxidising bacteria in the laboratory. Biases are associated with the isolation of bacteria in selective media and organisms cultivated in the laboratory may not be truly representative of those in the environment. In this study, we developed a competitive PCR (cPCR)-based method based on the amplification of 16S rRNA genes specific for the beta-subgroup proteobacterial ammonia oxidising bacteria for enumeration of these organisms. Populations in both agricultural soils and estuarine sediments were quantified by traditional MPN and by cPCR. The numbers of ammonia oxidisers for both sample types were significantly underestimated by conventional MPN and were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by cPCR. Higher numbers of ammonia oxidisers found in fertilised plots ill agricultural soils by the cPCR technique were not observed in MPN estimates. It was necessary to construct a separate standard curve for each sample type as differences in DNA extraction, quantity and purity had a significant bearing on the ease of PCR of both competitor and target DNA.

  abstract: "We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime -- a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field -- in southwest Michigan. We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production [&Delta;N2O/(&Delta;N2O+N2)], or rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN2O differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. Oxygen inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in N2O production (nitrate reductase, Nar; nitrite reductase, Nir; and nitric oxide reductase, Nor) to a greater extent in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field than in the community from the successional field. The Nar, Nir and Nor enzymes of the denitrifying community from the successional field, on the other hand, were more sensitive to pH than were those in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field. Moreover, the denitrifying community in the soil from the successional field had relatively more active nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) enzymes, which reduce N2O to N2, than the denitrifying community in the agricultural field. Also, the shape of the rN2O curve with increasing oxygen was different for each denitrifying community. Each of these differences suggests that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner. We thus conclude that native microbial community composition regulates an important ecosystem function in these soils. "

    Soil Water
    Content and Drainage Modeling of Kalamazoo Loam Soils with
    SALUS
  abstract: |-
    SALUS (Systems Approach to Land
    Use Sustainability) is a model for long-term simulation of soil
    health. SALUS can simulate rotations of different crops and/or
    fallow with different management strategies such as tillage,
    residue application, irrigation, tile drainage, and nitrogen
    application. The model combines the crop and water balance accuracy
    of CERES with the soil biochemistry simulation of CENTURY. The
    generic crop module uses the same algorithm to simulate growth and
    development for various cereal crops, so that the user only has to
    change species and cultivar coefficients.Four years of data
    (1991&#8211;94) from the interaction lysimeters were processed and
    simulated. The data were sorted and converted from a raw state to
    spreadsheets and SALUS input files. The data processed to-date are:
    drainage volume, nitrate concentrations, soil water content, and
    root images. Nitrate leaching mass was estimated from water
    drainage and nitrate concentration. SALUS input files such as
    weather, soils, crop information, and management files were
    prepared from the data.Because the lysimeters drain when
    the bottom-most layer is near saturated, we simulated the drainage
    as tile drainage. We simulated the hypothetical tile at the bottom
    of the lysimeter and a restrictive layer below the tile layer. This
    approach significantly improves simulation of soil water content.
    Lately we developed a new generic runoff module for SALUS that
    estimates runoff from daily rain, as a function of saturated
    hydraulic conductivity and a time-varying parameter. The lysimeter
    data were very helpful in testing and refining the latest SALUS
    enhancements.

  abstract: Population models indicate that managing agroecosystems to reduce weed seed survival in soil seedbanks has the potential to decrease weed populations. A series of bioassays was conducted in soil collected from the Long Term Ecological Research site at the Kellogg Biological Station in Hickory Corners, MI. We determined the effect of 1) contrasting agricultural management, 2) burial method, 3) surface sterilization, and 4) mechanical damage to seed coats on the proportion of weed seeds surviving a 28 d incubation in soil at 25 C and 330 kPa matric potential. Weed species included common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), field pennycress (Thaspi arvense), giant foxtail (Setaria faberi), kochia (Kochia scoparia), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), and yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca). Each of the four factors studied significantly (P < 0.05) affected weed seed survival. Seed survival rates of both giant foxtail and velvetleaf were 10 to 20% lower in conventionally managed soils than in soils managed with low, or no, chemical inputs. Burying seeds in mesh bags, a common experimental practice, increased velvetleaf seed mortality due to an increase in fatal germination, but had the opposite effect on giant foxtail seeds. Surface sterilization of the seed coat with 5% bleach for 5 minutes decreased velvetleaf seed survival by 7%, but increased giant foxtail seed survival by 40%. Survival of all six weed species was reduced by mechanical damage to the seed coat, with large declines in velvetleaf and kochia seed survival (77 and 83%, respectively). The wide range of weed seed survival rates in response to altered abiotic and biotic conditions holds promise for the development of agricultural management practices that reduce weed seed survival in soil seedbanks.

  title: 
  abstract: The dynamics of fine root systems for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) during seasonal harvests are important for plant regrowth, yet they are not well understood. The primary objective of this study was to determine fine root responses to multiple cuttings of an alfalfa crop for a 5-yr period and during an invasion of companion weed plants during the last 2 yr of the study. Root development, distribution, and turnover rates were evaluated by minirhizotron (MR) and microvideo camera methods on a Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). The development and distribution of alfalfa fine roots were modified more by season and age of the plants than by defoliation. New root development occurred primarily in the spring and immediately following rainfall interruptions of extended dry periods. Spatial accumulations of roots were observed at the interface of the Bt and 2Bt soil horizons, which also accumulated water and nutrients. More roots died with the progression of each season, especially when plants were 3 to 5 yr of age. New root growth decreased and root death rates increased at soil depths from 0 to 1.1 m, during the period between cuttings from July and August 1993 in the aging alfalfa stand, whose active region of root growth exceeded the depths of the MR observation tubes. New alfalfa root growth appeared at progressively greater depths, especially after 3 yr of cropping. Therefore, mature alfalfa root systems should be sampled to soil depths greater than 1 m. Root systems of encroaching weeds appeared to accumulate in the 0- to 0.6-m region of the soil profile.

  abstract: "The Verrucomicrobia constitute a newly discovered division of the Bacteria identified as a numerically abundant component of soil microbial communities in numerous sites around the world. The relative abundance of rRNA from Verrucomicrobia was investigated in the soil to examine the influence of specific environmental factors on the distribution of Verrucomicrobia and to better understand the distribution of this group in terrestrial ecosystems. The abundance of the verrucomicrobial rRNA was determined by using a novel oligonucleotide probe that is specific for verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA. The abundance of verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA in soil microbial communities was determined in relation to plant community composition and soil management history over a period of 2 years. Additional samples were analyzed to determine if verrucomicrobial rRNA relative abundance changes in relation to either soil depth or soil moisture content. The Verrucomicrobia composed 1.9&plusmn;0.2% of the microbial community rRNA present in the 85 soil samples examined. The distribution of verrucomicrobial rRNA in the soil reveals that Verrucomicrobia are significantly affected by environmental characteristics that change in relation to time, soil history, and soil depth, and reveals that a statistically significant amount of the variation in verrucomicrobial rRNA abundance can be explained by changes in soil moisture content.

  abstract: "The associations between common ground beetles and habitat and management characteristics were studied in an agricultural landscape that comprised part of the Long-Term Ecological Research site in southwestern Michigan. The 42-ha area included 7 habitat treatments, which represented 4 annual cropping systems in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., corn, Zea mays L., soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., rotation; 2 perennial crop systems (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., and Populus); and a native succession habitat. Pitfall traps were used to sample adult ground beetles during the growing seasons of 1994 and 1995. Four species numerically dominated the trap catches and together accounted for 87% of the total specimens collected: Cyclotrachelus sodalis (LeConte), Poecilus lucublandus (Say), Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), and Agonum placidum (Say). Differences in representation of these common species were most pronounced between perennial and annual plant systems. However, tillage also influenced the relative abundance of these species. The adult-overwintering, spring-breeding species, P. lucublandus and A. placidum, were most common in the annual crop habitats, particularly those under conventional tillage. Catch numbers of these 2 species were correlated positively suggesting similar habitat preferences or responses to management practices. In contrast, C. sodalis, a larval-overwintering, autumn breeder, was most common in the perennial crop systems and the annual crop system receiving no tillage. The exotic species P. melanarius showed the least response to the agricultural habitat treatments but was more abundant in managed crop habitats compared with the unmanaged succession habitat. Cluster analysis based on these 4 species indicated that plant type and tillage were important in distiniquishing the carabids of these habitats. The potential implications of these findings for conserving or enhancing ground beetle populations in agricultural systems are discussed. "

    Simulation
    of Soil Carbon Dynamics with SALUS
  abstract: |-
    Organic matter simulation models
    are typically used to simulate long-term dynamics of soil organic
    matter. The Century model, which runs on a daily time step, has
    been integrated into a crop simulation model, called SALUS (System
    Approach to Land Use Sustainability). SALUS runs on a daily time
    step. We tested the capabilities of SALUS to predict soil
    CO2 dynamics on a daily time step. The model was used to
    simulate soil carbon dynamics of a moldboard plowed (conventional)
    corn/soybean rotation. Results from an incubation study as well as
    14C dating were used to initialize the carbon pool sizes and the
    decomposition parameters of the model. The laboratory derived decay
    constants were reduced by 20% for the depths below 25
    cm.The model predicted trends in
    CO2-C evolution within a year quite well, although it
    tended to under predict CO2-C evolution during the
    summer months; it does not yet simulate root respiration. The
    tendency of SALUS to over predict CO2-C evolution in the
    fall is attributable to the fact that it does not consider a lag
    period until the residues are colonized and comminuted. In
    accordance with observed data, the model predicted a higher
    CO2-C evolution for 1994 as compared to 1993. The higher
    rates in 1994 were attributable to residues from the previous corn
    crop. In 1993, the previous crop was soybean. The model when run
    for two years with pool and flux rate data derived from laboratory
    measurements showed a slight accumulation of crop residues and an
    equivalent drop in the Cs.Return to Contents

  abstract: "This study examined a community of stream bivalves (unionids and fingernail clams) in a second-order woodland stream in southern Michigan using both the natural abundance of N-15 and a 6-week whole-stream N-15 enrichment experiment, as part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX). Objectives included addressing what made up the diet of these bivalves and whether suspended algae consumed by bivalves were derived from pelagic phytoplankton imported from an upstream lake or attached algae sloughed from instream surfaces. Within the examination of bivalve diets, we considered whether suspension- and/or deposit-feeding modes were employed and whether bivalves selectively assimilated the algal and microbial portions of bulk material they ingested. All 12 unionid species reached a level of N-15 enrichment greater than the bulk suspended organic matter. Sphaerium striatinum (Sphaeriidae) were enriched to levels greater than all presumed food sources. Suspended algae were derived both from sloughed epilithon and pelagic phytoplankton originating from lentic waters upstream. A mixing model suggested that unionids were consuming 80% deposited and 20% suspended material. Alternatively, these bivalves were preferentially assimilating the highly enriched living component of suspended and/or benthic organic matter rather than assimilating the bulk material. These results advance our understanding of freshwater bivalve-feeding ecology, which is necessary if conservation efforts of these increasingly threatened organisms are to succeed. "

  title: 
  abstract: Changes in species assemblages of predatory coccinellids in response to landscape structure (habitat diversity and patchiness) was studied in a southern Michigan landscape during 1989-1990. Three sites with different mosaics of cultivated (alfalfa, corn, wheat) and uncultivated (deciduous, field succession) habitats were sampled for coccinellid species using yellow sticky traps. The landscape at each site was characterized using the Berger-Parker index for habitat diversity and a relative patchiness index for habitat fragmentation. Relative abundance, species richness, species dominance, and the Kendall coefficient were used to analyze and compare species assemblages among sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract factor components per species and site scores, which were compared with landscape indices using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Thirteen species of coccinellids were captured during the 2 yr of weekly sampling. Of these species, Coccinella septempunctata (L.) was the dominant species in the landscape and was equally abundant in the 3 sites. Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake was more abundant in the site that had a corn habitat, whereas Cycloneda munda (Say), Chilocorus stigma (Say), and Brachiacantha ursina (F.) were more abundant in the site that had a deciduous habitat. Overall, the site with a deciduous habitat had higher species richness. There were significant differences in species composition between the site with a deciduous habitat and the other 2 sites. Differences observed among sites were significantly correlated with the presence of uncultivated habitats in the landscape.

    Using a Hybrid
    and Backcross larvae of Papilio canadensis and Papilio
    glaucus to Detect Induced Phytochemical Resistance in Hybrid
    Poplar Trees Experimentally Defoliated by Gypsy
    Moths
  abstract: |-
    Sub-plots of hybrid poplars in the Long Term
    Ecological Study site for "Agroecology" at the Kellogg Biological
    Station were experimentally defoliated using 10 million gypsy moth
    larvae. Half of the defoliated (and undefoliated control) plots
    were fertilized to see if this would ameliorate the predicted
    induction of carbon-based phenolic defenses in the regrowth of
    leaves. In order to bioassay the leaves of the four different
    treatments, we employed a continuum of genotypes (different hybrids
    and backcrosses of two different species of tiger swallowtail
    butterflies) with different abilities to detoxify these
    allelochemicals. Based on our previous studies with phytochemicals
    from the Salicaceae plant family, Papilio canadensis was
    likely to consume and process all Populus spp treatments,
    whereas P. glaucus predicted to either not consume or else
    quickly die on all Populus treatment leaves. Hybrid and
    backcross larvae of these two butterfly species are known to have
    intermediate levels of esterase detoxication enzymes and would
    therefore be likely to provide a continuum or at least varying
    degrees of sensitivity in bioassays for even the most subtle
    induction responses in the regrowth leaves. This presumption was
    supported in the feeding and growth studies conducted at different
    times post-defoliation during the 1997 growing season in
    Michigan.Fig 1.&nbsp;

Fertilizer was added to two plots in replicate communities over the course of five years (1994-1999) at levels of 10 kg/ha/yr and 30kg/ha/yr, respectively. Potential nitrification rates were measured using an enzyme inhibition method. I was not able to detect any difference between fertilizer levels. However, I found a significant difference between the potential nitrification rates of mid-successional and late successional ecosystems. The mid-successional ecosystem had a significantly (p<0.05) lower amount of mean potential nitrification (0.0176 (\xB5g/g dry soil/day) occurring in the top 16cm of soil than did the late successional ecosystem (0.0869 (\xB5g/g dry soil/day).

This study was aimed at determining the specific contributions of above- and belowground alfalfa biomass to soil N pools. Dynamics of soil and plant N pools were studied in a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) over a 2-yr period under bare fallow (BF), bare fallow to which alfalfa shoot mulch was applied (BFSM), living alfalfa plants with shoots removed after harvest (A), and living alfalfa with shoot mulch remaining on the soil surface after harvest (ASM). Organic N pools were monitored in alfalfa plant parts, soil-incorporated debris, and soil organic matter to depths of 150 cm. Inorganic N pools were monitored by suction lysimeters, soil extraction, and evaluation of soil denitrification rates. Living alfalfa stands kept soil inorganic N at very low levels, whether shoot mulch was applied or not. Soluble inorganic N concentrations decreased earlier in the fall in the upper horizons of bare fallow soils receiving alfalfa shoot mulch, suggesting enhanced leaching from bare soil under alfalfa mulch, Alfalfa crown and roots contained an average of 115 kg N ha(-1) after 2 yr of treatment, In conclusion, alfalfa shoot mulch contributed little to sustained increases in soil N pools, while crowns and roots contributed larger quantities to the soil N pool.

  abstract: |-
    The influence of biodiversity on ecosystem processes has been the subject of considerable research effort and debate among plant and animal ecologists but the ecosystem consequences of microbial diversity are largely unknown.&nbsp; I tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production.&nbsp; I used a soil enzyme assay to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O.&nbsp; By controlling, or providing in non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, I created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production in soils from two fields in southwest Michigan was denitrifier community composition.&nbsp; I found that the denitrification enzymes of the denitrifying communities&nbsp; from the two fields differed substantially in their sensitivities to oxygen and pH, indicating that the denitrifying communities in these two soils respond to environmental regulators differently.
    I also isolated denitrifying bacteria from these same soil samples and, for 31 representative isolates, measured the sensitivity of their nos enzymes, which catalyze the reduction of N2O to N2, to low levels of oxygen.&nbsp; Cluster analysis of the cellular fatty acid profiles of 93 denitrifying bacteria isolated from the agricultural field and 63 from the successional field showed 27 denitrifying taxa with only 12 common to both soils.&nbsp; In addition, I found substantial diversity in the degree of sensitivity of the isolates' nos enzymes to oxygen, indicating that the taxonomic diversity present among denitrifiers in these two soils is functionally significant.&nbsp; These results demonstrate a clear potential for differences in denitrifier community composition to affect differences in N2O production among ecosystems, independent of direct environmental controls.
    I also investigated the spatial distribution of microbial community structure along a transect in a conventionally-tilled agricultural field.&nbsp; I used fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile analysis, a rapid technique that allows processing of the large number of samples required for spatial analyses of microbial community structure,&nbsp; I applied principal components analysis to these data and showed that, while a majority of 167 soil samples had similar FAME profiles, about 20 percent of samples had relatively low and about 10 percent had relatively high bacterial:fungal ratios.&nbsp; Using semivariance analysis I was able to capture and describe small-scale patterns of microbial population distributions.&nbsp; Where autocorrelation occurred, it was generally at scakes &lt; 0.2 m, a scale analogous to individual soil peds and rhizospheres.

  abstract: "Adult parasitoids frequently require access to food and adequate microclimates to maximize host location and parasitization. Realized levels of parasitism in the field can be significantly influenced by the quantity and distribution of extra-host resources. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant effect of landscape structure on parasitism of the armyworm Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). As a possible mechanism underlying this pattern, we investigated the effect of carbohydrate food sources on the longevity and fecundity of armyworm parasitoids under laboratory conditions of varying temperature, host availability, and mating status. Glyptapanteles, militaris (Walsh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) adults lived significantly longer when provided with honey as food and when reared at 20degreesC versus 25degreesC. Meteorus communis (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) adults also lived significantly longer when provided with honey, although longevity was reduced when females were provided hosts. Honey-fed females of M. communis parasitized significantly more hosts because of their increased longevity, but did not differ in daily oviposition from females provided only water. Mating significantly increased parasitism by honey-fed M. communis, but not those provided water alone. These results indicate that the presence of both carbohydrate resources and moderated microclimates may significantly increase the life span and parasitism of these parasitoids. However, the greater longevity and lower daily rate of oviposition of M. communis suggest that food and microclimate resources are more critical for this species than for the shorter lived, gregarious G. militaris. These findings contribute to our understanding of how these two parasitoids respond to landscape complexity. "

    Concentric
    Layers of Soil Carbon and Microbial Populations in Soil Aggregates

  abstract: |-
    Surface accumulations of recently deposited and
    labile soil C on soil aggregates establish heterogenous C gradients
    along planes of weakness within soils. Carbon deposited by plant
    roots were evaluated by the natural abundance of 13C in
    whole aggregates and peeled fractions from concentric layers of
    aggregates ranging from 7 - 11 mm across. Surface layers can be
    peeled from aggregates ranging from 0.5 to 15 mm across by the new
    soil aggregation erosion (SAE) chambers developed at Michigan State
    University. Twice as much C is located on surface layers than is
    within interior regions of soil aggregates from agricultural soils.
    Following 20 months of alfalfa (C3-C), nearly 80% of
    newly deposited soil C originated from the concurrent alfalfa crop.
    Less than 25% of C sequestered within aggregates originated from
    the alfalfa. New C inputs by corn and rye roots were 0.41 and 1.45
    g C kg-1 soil for the 0-5 cm depths. Increased C coupled
    with N gradients, reported earlier, result in 200% increases in the
    gradients of C:N from the exterior to interior regions of soil
    aggregates, Table 1. These and other factors control microbial
    populations of fungi within soil aggregates of the Kalamazoo loam

  title: 
  abstract: "Integrated cropping systems use biological resources such as organic fertilizers, nitrogen fixing plants, and crop and cover crop residues to reduce the need for chemical inputs and improve sustainability. This research explores the effect of integrated management on nitrogen mineralization in a variety of corn-based agricultural rotations and early successional treatments at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) in Southwestern MI. Part 1 defines the effect of management on the seasonal dynamics of nitrogen mineralization potential (NMP), the intrinsic ability of a soil to mineralize N over time (ideally a growing season). Measurements of NMP, based on the accumulation of inorganic N in soils incubated under aerobic conditions for 10, 30, 70, 150 and 310 days at 25 \xB0C, are evaluated using 1st order mineralization kinetics and repeated measures analysis of variance. Nitrogen mineralization potential was greatest in the spring and lowest in the fall in all treatments. It increased in response to compost additions, was greater in low-input rotations with cover crops than in conventional rotations, and was greater in successional treatments without tillage than in tilled succession or agronomic treatments. During a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation, NMP was lowest under 2nd year corn and highest under wheat and 1st year corn, reflecting both legume inputs and the lack of spring tillage in wheat. Part 2 of the research found that macroorganic matter was correlated with NMP in most treatments, but that microbial biomass was not. The strongest correlation (r2=.41) was between macroorganic C in the 53-2000 m m size class and inorganic N accumulation in 150 day incubations. Macroorganic matter increased more rapidly after compost additions than NMP, but was less affected by residue inputs. Part 3 of the research found that conventional fertilization produced higher corn and wheat yields and greater leaching loss than additions of leaf and dairy compost. Net annual N mineralization (calculated from plant uptake and leaching loss) was greater in the compost treatments, but N availability was low because of lower than expected compost mineralization (9% yr-1). Nitrogen mineralization was greatest in years with corn production and lowest in years with soybean and wheat production, reflecting (in part) differences in residue input from the previous crop. Much of the variation in N mineralization could be predicted by laboratory measurements of NMP and macroorganic matter, particularly total macroorganic N (53 \x96 2000 m m), potentially mineralizable organic matter (No), and N mineralization predicted in 70 and 150 day incubations based on the 1st order kinetics. Leaching loss (October through September) was best predicted by initial inorganic N and total inorganic N (initial plus mineralized) in incubations performed after sidedress fertilization in the preceding season. This research shows that N mineralization varies appreciably within and between growing seasons, and responds predictably to integrated agricultural management."

  title: 
  abstract: Distribution of root systems through soils and recolonization of root channels by successive crops are fundamental, though difficult to study, processes of soil ecology. This article reports a minirhizotron (MR) study of corn and alfalfa root systems throughout the soil profile of Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) monolith lysimeters for a three-year succession of corn, alfalfa and corn. Multiple-date comparisons within and between years were conducted to estimate total root densities in each soil horizon. Root recolonization was assessed by comparing every video frame of paired minirhizotrons, from recordings conducted one growing season apart. Distributions of corn root systems were modified by tillage practices. In 1994, root populations of corn in the Bt(1) horizon peaked 75-90 days after planting (DAP). Numbers of corn poets per m(2) in the Bt(1) horizon were consistently higher for ns-tillage (NT) than for conventional tillage (CT) lysimeters, in 1994 and 1996. Distribution of alfalfa roots within the soil profile was not significantly modified by tillage. However, alfalfa root decomposition rates responded to conventional and no-tillage practices and were specific for each soil horizon. Corn root systems growing in soils previously cropped with alfalfa presented similar patterns of root distribution by horizons as that of the previous alfalfa crop. Successive corn root systems did not display similar distribution patterns throughout the soil profile from one growing season to the next. Proportions of roots of the current crop recolonizing root induced macropores (RIMs) of the previous crop averaged 18% for corn after corn, 22% for alfalfa after corn and 41% for corn after alfalfa, across Bt horizons and tillage treatments. In conclusion, distribution of corn root systems appeared to be modified by tillage practices and root recolonization of RIMs was controlled by the preceding crop.

    Conservation tillage is becoming more widely accepted as an alternative tillage system in crop production. Organic matter and microbial activity may increase with no-tillage (NT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). Accumulation of organic matter and phosphorus (P) near the surface of soil occurs in NT soils which may affect the distribution of P pools in soils. The effect of NT and CT on soil P fractions was investigated, and the turnover rates of 33P added in soybean residues to soils from three experimental sites in Michigan was determined. The role of microorganisms in the turnover of 33P added in residues was also studied in a never tilled soil. The effect of microorganisms was separated by sterilizing the soil with gamma irradiation before adding the residues. Phosphorus transformations were compared in the sterilized and non-sterilized soil.
    Soybean plants labeled with 33P were added to soils, incubated at field capacity, extracted periodically (0, 6, 12, 18, 26, and 34 days), and P analyzed in the different P fractions. The fractions extracted were resin, NaHC03, microbial biomass, NaOH, NaOH after sonication, HCI, and residue P fractions.
    With NT inorganic P accumulated in the calcareous soil which received P fertilizers. NaOH extractable organic P (Po) concentrations were higher in the NT treatments in the two non-calcareous soils. There was no effect of tillage on the labile Po pool.
    The largest fraction of the applied 33P was found in the inorganic labile form. This fraction decreased with time with an increase in the NaOH fraction in all three soils. An increase in the HC1 fraction occurred in the calcareous soil. Phosphorus cycling through the microbial pool was evident before more of the 33P ended up in the NaOH fraction. The effect of tillage on the 33P turnover was minimal in all the P fractions extracted including the microbial fraction.
    Twenty percent of the 33P was found in the microbial pool at day 12 in the nonsterilized never tilled soil. About 6% to 11% of the 33P found in the NaOH fraction is suspected to be organic and have cycled through the microbial pool.

  abstract: |-
    An integrated model of agricultural and natural
    resource ecosystems requires a multidimensional approach that
    allows the study of points of interaction between natural and
    social systems. Key points of integration include chemical,
    biological, geomorphological and social dimensions. Research on
    social dimensions in LTER will provide for a better understanding
    of the factors that influence the adoption and incorporation of
    different management practices and how human populations evaluate
    these changes in relation to the environmental impact of
    agriculture on rural resources.Both natural and social systems have histories,
    and the essence of LTER is to mark changes in agricultural and
    natural ecosystems. Shifts in social dimensions that have long term
    impacts on agricultural and natural resource ecosystems, especially
    at the KBS LTER site, will be examined. Social dimensions include:
    a) demographic; b) economic; c) cultural; and d) social structure

    Managing nitrogen (N) for maximum crop use efficiency and minimum environmental impact in agricultural systems that use organic versus fertilizer N inputs requires more information on N cycling in these systems.&nbsp; The overall objective of this research was to compare N cycling in animal-, legume-, and fertilizer-based cropping systems with an emphasis on evaluating each system for its potential to lose N to the environment.&nbsp; Specific objectives were 1) to trace the fate of red clover (trifolium pratense L.) and ammonium sulphate 15N into crops plus soil, and calculate loss by subtraction, 2) measure the soil N supplying capacity using long-term laboratory incubations, 3) measure NO3-N leaching using lysimeters, and 4) measure the effect of mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) on recovery of legume and fertilizer 15N by corn using a modified 15N method.
    15N-labeled red clover and ammonium sulphate were applied to microplots in the long-term Rodale farming systems trial located in east central Pennsylvania in 1987 and 1988 and traced into first-year corn (Zea mays L.), second-year barley (Hordeum distichum L.) and soil after each crop.&nbsp; Over a 2-y period, more fertilizer N was contributed to crops (40 vs. 17% of input), more legume N was contributed to soil (47 vs. 17% of input) and a similar amount of N from both sources was lost from the cropping systems (39% of input).
    Long-term (200 + d), aerobic, incubations of soil sampled from the Rodale farming systems in 1988 showed that the N supplying capacity of the animal-based cropping system was greater than the legume- and fertilizer-based systems which were similar.&nbsp; A double exponential model was used to estimate the size of the active fraction of soil organic matter N, which was greater in the animal-than legume-based system, which in turn was greater than in the fertilizer-based system.
    Nitrate leaching from the animal-, legume-, and fertilizer-based cropping systems at Rodale was measured over a 2-y period starting in Fall 1990 using 0.76 m dia. by 1.0 m deep intact, natural drainage lysimeters.&nbsp; Most NO3-N leached was derived from soil organic matter and not from the applied legume and fertilizer N sources as determined using 15N.
    15N-labeled fertilizer and legume plant material were applied to unlabeled soil, and vice versa, infield microplots at two locations in Michigan in 1991.&nbsp; It was determined that MIT had not effect on recovery of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), or ammonium sulphate 15N by corn.

  abstract: "Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) stands have been reported to either decrease or increase nitrate (NO3) leaching, depending on tillage management. The fate of alfalfa-generated N and its interaction with N fertilization in a subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) crop remains uncertain. Alfalfa contributions to corn yields and soil mineral N pools were studied under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems over a 3-yr corn-alfalfa-corn sequence. The field experiment compared CT vs. NT managements in fertilized and nonfertilized Kalamazoo loam soils (Typic Hapludalf), Four of the nonfertilized plots were equipped with undisturbed monolith lysimeters to monitor NO3 leaching. Living alfalfa stands lost 6 kg N ha(-1) to deep leaching over a l-yr period, which is much less than the 20 kg NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1) lost by nonfertilized corn following corn. Within the first 6 mo following the spray-killing of the stand, alfalfa plant tissue decomposition contributed to soil mineral N pools up to 115 kg N ha(-1). During a dry year, all corn N requirements were met by plant tissue decomposition of alfalfa and soil organic matter mineralization, while applied N fertilizer accumulated in the soil profile and was highly susceptible to spring leaching. Similar quantities of N were lost to deep leaching from CT and NT systems during corn production, as higher drainage rates in NT systems were compensated by lower NO3-N concentration of the leachates.

  title: 
  abstract: "The adoption of alternative management practices has been shown to increase soil organic matter. However, the effect of adopting these practices on soil phosphorus (P), especially organic P, is not clear. We evaluated the effect of such practices-mainly no-tillage, zero and low-chemical input, organic-based, row crop agricultural systems-on soil P and compared them with conventional agriculture and perennial farming systems. We also compared soil P under conventional agriculture to an adjacent forest site and a never-tilled native successional community site in southwest Michigan. Sequential fractionation analysis of soil inorganic and organic P fractions showed that long-term conventional row crop agriculture resulted in a 79% reduction of NaOH-extractable organic P compared with adjacent forested sites. The calcium phosphate pool and the residual P fraction, however, increased under conventional agriculture compared with the forest site, probably because of fertilizer inputs. Adoption of no-tillage and low-chemical input systems with a winter leguminous cover crop in the rotation for 7 years did not increase organic P significantly in any of the fractions extracted from the annual cropping systems. However, organic P extracted by NaOH increased to 22.1% after adoption of continuous alfalfa for the same period compared with 11.4% extracted under conventionally tilled annual cropping systems. We conclude that continuous alfalfa. can help restore soils to their native P fertility levels by taking up P from the stable residual fraction and transforming it into moderately labile organic P through root death. We found no evidence that low chemical input organic based systems are sustainable with regard to P as there is no evidence that organic P is accumulating as a result of the use of cover crops. Further investigation is warranted after these soils become P limiting and more years have passed under the same treatments. "

    Distribution
    of Ligninolytic Enzymes in Soil
    Basidiomycetes
  abstract: |-
    Soil basidiomycetes isolated from KBS were
    examined for the distribution and relative abundance&Otilde;s of
    lignin peroxidase, (LIP), manganese dependent peroxidase (MNP) and
    laccase (LAC). The abundance&Otilde;s of these ligninolytic enzymes
    produced by 25 isolates were correlated to two soil treatments;
    physical perturbation (tillage) and diversity (species richness and
    heterogeneity) of plant material inputs. LAC was produced by 90% of
    all isolates. MNP was produced by 40% of all isolates. No isolates
    produced LIPs although the potential for the production was
    evidenced through molecular probing. 75% of all isolates from the
    tilled soils produced LAC in vitro and 62.5% produced MNP. 40% of
    the isolates from the no-till soils produced LAC in vitro and 33.3%
    produced MNP. 82.5% of the isolates from the successional plant
    treatment soils produced LAC in vitro and 62.5% produced MNP. These
    data support the hypotheses that basidiomycetes isolated from a
    physically disturbed site have a higher distribution of
    ligininolytic enzymes than isolates from a non-disturbed site and
    basidiomycetes isolated from a soil with a high diversity of plant
    material inputs have a higher distribution of ligninolytic enzymes
    than those isolated from a soil with a lesser diversity of plant
    material inputs.

  abstract: "1. The Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX) was a coordinated study of the relationships between North American biomes and factors governing ammonium uptake in streams. Our objective was to relate inter-biome variability of ammonium uptake to physical, chemical and biological processes.  2. Data were collected from 11 streams ranging from arctic to tropical and from desert to rainforest. Measurements at each site included physical, hydraulic and chemical characteristics, biological parameters, whole-stream metabolism and ammonium uptake. Ammonium uptake was measured by injection of N-15-ammonium and downstream measurements of N-15-ammonium concentration. 3. We found no general, statistically significant relationships that explained the variability in ammonium uptake among sites. However, this approach does not account for the multiple mechanisms of ammonium uptake in streams. When we estimated biological demand for inorganic nitrogen based on our measurements of in-stream metabolism, we found good correspondence between calculated nitrogen demand and measured assimilative nitrogen uptake. 4. Nitrogen uptake varied little among sites, reflecting metabolic compensation in streams in a variety of distinctly different biomes (autotrophic production is high where allochthonous inputs are relatively low and vice versa).5. Both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism require nitrogen and these biotic processes dominate inorganic nitrogen retention in streams. Factors that affect the relative balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism indirectly control inorganic nitrogen uptake. "

  abstract: "Although alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) stands have been reported to improve soil physical properties, little is known about the specific influences of above- and belowground alfalfa components on soil physical properties. A 2-yr study was conducted to investigate alfalfa roof and shoot mulch modifications of soil physical properties and water movement in the root zone of a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) in southwest Michigan, Four treatments were considered: bare fallow (BF), bare fallow with alfalfa shoot mulch (BFSM), alfalfa with shoots removed and roots remaining (AR), and alfalfa with alfalfa shoot mulch (ASM). Volumetric soil water contents were measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR). Development of fine roots was monitored by minirhizotron technology. Alfalfa root systems increased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) by 57%, total and macroporosities by 1.7 and 1.8%, respectively, and water recharge rate of the soil profile by as much as 5.4% per day. These effects of alfalfa roots on soil porosity were mainly attributed to increased amplitudes of wetting and drying cycles and high rates of root turnover in the Ap horizon. K-sat was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r = 0.90, P less than or equal to 0.01). Mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates From bare fallow soils was 20% higher when alfalfa shoot mulch was applied, Our results suggest that aggregate stability was more affected by C sources from shoot mulch and root turnover than by factors specific to root activities such as physical enmeshment of aggregates and increased soil wetting and drying cycles.

  title: 
  abstract: |-
    I conducted species removal and resource addition experiments in a first- and second-year old-field in southwestern Michigan to test two mechanistic hypotheses about the relationship between diversity and productivity: 1) plant diversity declines with increasing fertility due to increasing competition intensity from the dominant species, and 2) the time of resource addition within a season influences the magnitude of competition intensity, and consequently the effect of a dominant species on community structure.
    In the first-year annual old-field the effect of the dominant species, Chenopodium album, on subordinate community biomass, evenness, diversity, and nitrogen acquisition depended on the time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; When nitrogen was added early in the growing season (early July) both the dominant species and the subordinate community increases in biomass and total nitrogen content relative to the unfertilized control.&nbsp; However, when nitrogen was added mid- or late-season, the dominant species pre-empted the added nitrogen and exhibited a disproportionate increase in biomass relative to the subordinate community.&nbsp; The subordinate plant community had increased tissue nitrogen concentrations but did not increase in biomass.&nbsp; The degree of canopy development appears to determine the ability of dominant and subordinate species to acquire added nutrients and allocate them to increased growth rather than storage, and thus, influences the magnitude of the effect of the dominant species on diversity and community structure.
    In the second-year old-field community the composition and abundance of species in the subordinate community varied seasonally, while Conyze canadensis was the clear biomass dominant.&nbsp; Biomass evenness and diversity but not richness declined with increasing C. canadensis biomass.&nbsp; Nitrogen addition reduced evenness and diversity but not richness, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary with the time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; Rather the biomass of life-history/growth form groups and individual species varied with time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; Light penetration was lower and nitrogen availability was higher in nitrogen addition plots early and mid-season, but by mid-August, resources declined to the same low level in control and nitrogen addition plots.
    Finally, I present a general graphical and statistical approach to evaluate the absolute and relative response of a species biomass hierarchy to experimental treatments or environmental perturbations.

  abstract: "Minimum tillage may alter soil P fractions through the application of P fertilizers and the deposition of organic matter on the surface rather than being incorporated into the soil. This study was conducted to determine whether no-tillage (NT) systems affected soil organic and inorganic P fractions and the transformation of P from residues applied to soils. Surface soils (0-2 cm) under NT and conventional tillage (CT) were sampled from three long-term research sites. Inorganic and organic P was measured in the NaHCO3 microbial, NaOH, NaOH after sonication, HCl, and residual fractions extracted sequentially. Soybean (Glycine maw L.) residues labeled with P-33 were added to soils, incubated, and extracted periodically, and P-33 was counted in the different P fractions. Levels of (3)1P in NT were higher in some of the fractions compared with CT; however, there was no consistency in P-31 fractionation across soil types due to tillage in any of the inorganic and organic fractions. At the start of incubation, 56 to 82% of the applied P-33 was extracted in the resin fraction in the three soils. Resin-P-33 followed a three-parameter single exponential decay model with a corresponding increase in other pools depending on soil. The increase in these pools followed a quadratic model in the three soils. By the end of the incubation period, the NaOH fraction accounted for the majority of the UP released from the labile resin pool. An increase in the calcium phosphate pool occurred in the calcareous soil. Tillage had no effect on the fate of P-33 released from soybean residues during the incubation period. "

  abstract: <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>, a dep roted C4 bunch gras was transplanted to thre &quot;old field&quot; sucesional sites at the Kelog Biological Station.Five years after establishment, samples were taken from the rhizosphere of the Andropogon and the nearby sucesional comunity. Sampling was at plant senesence. Six replicates were taken at each of thre sites. Nematodes were extracted from soil using the Baerman funel technique. They were identified to genus, and asigned to life history groups; plant parasite, plant asociate, fungal feder, bacterial feder, algal feder, omnivore and carnivore. Several measures of comunity structure were aplied to the resulting data. There were no consistent treatment diferences acros al thre sites. The thre sites showed diferences in the ratio of Fungivore to bacterivore nematodes, in descending order:Lower Louden, Turkey and McKay. This is consistent with the phospholipid faty acid marker data from the same samples. At Lower Louden the greatest diference betwen treatments for fungivore / bacterivore nematode ratio was measured, with the Sucesional treatment &gt; Andropogon (P&lt;=0.10). There were no significant diferences for this measure at the other two locations. There were other site specific diferences in nematode comunity structure by treatment. None were consistent acros al sites.

Four management types, conventional (CO), integrated fertilizer (IF), integrated compost (IC), and transitional organic (TO) were applied to two crop sequences, a corn (Zea mays L.)-corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation and continuous corn, which were grown with and without cover crops in the IF, IC, and TO managements. Using compost as a fertility source and reducing the use of herbicides and other chemicals resulted in long-term changes in soil organic matter pools such TO greater than or equal to IC &gt; IF greater than or equal to CO for total C and N and for the labile C and N measured through aerobic incubations at 70 and 150 d. Mineralizable N varied within the rotation, tending to increase after soybean and decrease after corn production in all systems. Corn yield was closely associated with 70-d N mineralization potential, being greatest for first-year corn with cover and least for continuous corn without cover under all management types. Although the TO and IC systems produced the lowest yield for second-year or continuous corn, the combination of soybean and wheat plus red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) always supported high yield for first-year corn. Fall nitrate level and nitrate leaching were higher for commercially fertilized corn than for any other crop or for compost-amended corn. "

  abstract: "Nitrate leaching from maize (Zea naps L.,) fields fertilized in excess of plant requirements continue to threaten water quality even though many agronomists have recommended reducing N fertilization rates to contain this environmental risk, inbred maize has lower N uptake than conventional hybrid maize; therefore, inbred maize production exposes soils to even greater ground water pollution risks by nitrates. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted on sandy loam seas in southwestern Michigan to investigate the combined effects of N fertilization rates and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops on NO3 leaching in inbred maize fields, Inbred maize was fertilized at 0, 101, and 202 kg N ha(-1). Annual NO3 leaching losses were 7 kg N ha(-1) higher in fields fertilized at 101 ks N ha(-1) than in nonfertilized controls. Annual NO3 leaching losses to ground water between May 1995 and April 1998 from lysimeters fertilized at 202 kg N ha(-1) averaged 88 kg NO3-N ha(-1). Rye interseeded with inbred maize fertilized at 202 kg N ha(-1) sequestered from 46 to 56 kg ha(-1) of excess fertilizer N, Rye scavenged little residual fertilizer N in plots fertilized at 101 kg N ha(-1). Well established rye cover crops in 1996 reduced NO3 leaching by as much as 65 kg N ha(-1) when the previous crop was fertilized with 202 kg N ha(-1). Therefore, rye cover crops sequestered substantial amounts of soil NO3 in heavily fertilized inbred maize fields. "

  title: Paterns Of Enterprise, Ecosystem And Nematode Comunity Quality
  abstract: A series of relatively simple conceptual indices were designed for use in identification of paterns of agricultural enterprise, soil ecosystem and nematode comunity quality. The enterprise quality component takes into consideration system age, goal acomplishments and ecosystem structure. The soil quality analysis is based on system disturbance, nature of abiotic factors and extent of interdependence among biotic parameters. Paterns of nematode comunity ecology are evaluated through use of system disturbance, taxon composition and population density. The procedure wil be tested using nematode and soil data from the Kelog Biological Station, Long-Term Ecological Research Program and the Living Field Laboratory, and other nematode comunity ecology research sites throughout Michigan. It wil also be used for education and discusion purposes. The evaluation criteria are based in-part from the works of Capra (196) and Feris, Bongers and de Goede (19).

  abstract: "Little information is available regarding N management of inbred maize (Zea mays L.), which exports less N than hybrid maize. Nitrate contamination of the groundwater has been a concern in St Joseph County in southwest Michigan where &gt;20 000 ha of seed maize are grown on sand and sandy loam soils. Over application of N fertilizer potentially reduces profits of the local growers and poses a threat to the environment. A field experiment was conducted from 1990 to 1994 to estimate N fertilizer requirements of three different inbred varieties for maximizing yields while minimizing ground water pollution. Yield and N content of grain and stover were analyzed at the end of each growing season. Nitrate leaching was monitored throughout the 5 yr of study by collecting and analyzing drainage flows out of five large field lysimeters. Grain yield was the least responsive to N fertilization, compared with stover biomass, and grain and stover N concentrations. Analyses of yield, NO3-N leaching and soil N balance indicated that the appropriate fertilization of the P38 mid-season inbred approximated 108 kg N ha(-1). Nitrate leaching out of unfertilized plots reached a threshold of 12 to 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), during the last 2 gr of treatment. Application of 101 and 202 kg N ha(-1) generated an average annual loss of 26 and 60 kg N ha(-1), respectively, during the last 2 gr of treatment. "

  title: Bacterial Comunities of Physical Soil Fractions
  abstract: Two hypotheses for how the imense diversity in soil bacterial comunities is maintained are 1. high habitat diversity 2. low competition due to dormancy of cels. We hypothesized that the light fraction (LF) is a unique microbial habitat analogous to the rhizosphere. LF is a rapidly-cycling soil carbon pol isolated through density separation and sieving. Soil samples were taken from KBS LTER alfalfa plots and Living Field Lab continuous corn, conventional management plots. Samples were sieved to isolate 1. rhizosphere 2. shot residue &gt;2m and 3. bulk soil. Bulk soil was then separated into LF and heavy fraction (HF, soil agregates and other minerals) by centrifugation in water. Bacterial T-RFLP fingerprints were obtained by DNA extraction from each fraction, folowed by PCR amplification with fluorescently-labeled eubacterial primers, and restriction with HhaI. Total bacterial population sizes and populations within cel size clases were determined by digital image analysis of soil smears stained with DTAF. <font size="2">Soil bacterial populations were highest in soil fractions where freshly deposited substrate is concentrated (<a href="Figures/blackwod_figure_1.htm">carbon hotspots, Figure 1</a>). This phenomenon is more general than the rhizosphere-efect, including LF and shot residue. The comunities of hotspots contained an increased number of large cels, indicative of increased activity. But the proportion of CTC-active cels was constant acros soil fractions. Further studies ned to be performed to determine the level of activity of soil bacterial cels and the location of the most active cels. Substrate availability had a large impact on bacterial comunity composition (</font><a href="Figures/blackwod_figure_2.htm"><font size="2">Figure 2</font></a><font size="2">). Hotspot comunities were very diferent from bulk soil comunities. In adition, LF and shot residue comunities were nearly identical but distinct from the rhizosphere. Croping history also caused divergence of comunities within each habitat type. A wide diversity of habitats is likely to be found in soils, particularly those with more heterogeneous plant asemblages.</font>Soil bacterial populations were highest in soil fractions where freshly deposited substrate is concentrated (<a href="Figures/blackwod_figure_1.htm">carbon hotspots, Figure 1</a>).

  abstract: "The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and the northern tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, overlap geographically as well as in their host ranges. Adult female swallowtails are incapable of distinguishing between damaged and undamaged leaves, and the opportunities for competition between these two species are numerous. We designed field and laboratory experiments to look for evidence of indirect competition between P. canadensis and L. dispar larvae. Swallowtail caterpillars were reared in the laboratory on leaves from gypsy-moth-defoliated and undefoliated trees to explore host-plant effects. We tested for pathogen-mediated interactions by rearing swallowtail larvae on both sterilized and unsterilized leaves from defoliated and undefoliated sources. In addition, we measured the effects of known gypsy moth pathogens, as well as gypsy moth body fluids, on the growth and survival of swallowtail larvae. Field experiments were designed to detect the presence of parasitoid-mediated competition, as well: we recorded parasitism of swallowtail caterpillars placed in the field either where there were no gypsy moth larvae present, or where we had artificially created dense gypsy moth populations. We found evidence that swallowtails were negatively affected by gypsy moths in several ways: defoliation by gypsy moths depressed swallowtail growth rate and survival, whether leaves were sterilized or not; sterilization significantly reduced the effect of defoliation, and gypsy moth body fluids proved lethal; and swallowtail caterpillars suffered significantly increased rates of parasitism when they were placed in the field near gypsy moth infestations.

  abstract: "We used natural C-13 abundance in soils to calculate the fate of C-4-C inputs in fields cropped to continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Soil samples were collected from eight cultivated and six adjacent, noncultivated sites: of the Corn Belt region of the central USA, The amount of organic C in cultivated soils declined an average of 68%, compared with adjacent, noncultivated sites. The delta C-13 Of cultivated soil profiles that had been under continuous corn for 8 to 35 yr increased in all depth increments above that of the noncultivated profiles. The percentage of soil organic C (SOC) derived from corn residues and roots ranged from 22 to 40% of the total C. The proportion of corn-derived C, as determined by this technique, decreased with soil depth and was minimal iri the 50- to 100-cm depth increments of fine-fextured soils. The mean residence time of the non-corn C (C-3) ranged from 36 to 108 yr at the surface, and np to 769 yr at the subsoil depth, The longer turnover times were associated with soils high in clay. Prairie-derived soils have a higher potential to sequester C than those derived from forests. The significant loss of total C at all sites and the slow turnover times of the incorporated C lead us to conclude that there is a substantial potential for soils to serve as a C sink and as a significant nutrient reserve in sustainable agriculture.

  abstract: "The dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) play an important role in long-term ecosystem productivity and the global C cycle. We used extended laboratory incubation and acid hydrolysis to analytically determine SOC pool sizes and fluxes in US Corn Belt soils derived from both forest and prairie vegetation. Measurement of the natural abundance of C-13 made it possible to follow the influence of continuous corn on SOC accumulation. The active pools (C-a) comprised 3 to 8% of the SOC with an average field mean residence time (MRT) of 100 d. The slow pools (C-s) comprised 50% of SOC in the surface and up to 65% in subsoils. They had field MRTs from 12-28 y for C-4-C and 40-80 y for C-3-derived C depending on soil type and location. No-till management increased the MRT of the C-3-C by 10-15 y above conventional tillage. The resistant pool (C-r) decreased from an average of 50% at the surface to 30% at depth. The isotopic composition of SOC mineralized during the early stages of incubation reflected accumulations of labile C from the incorporation of corn residues. The CO2 released later reflected C-13 characteristic of the C-s pool. The C-13 Of the CO2 did not equal that of the whole soil until after 1000 d of incubation. The SOC dynamics determined by acid hydrolysis, incubation and C-13 content were dependent on soil heritage (prairie vs. forest), texture, cultivation and parent material, depositional characteristics. Two independent methods of determining C-3 pool sizes derived from C-3 vegetation gave highly correlated values. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. "

  abstract: "The literature was reviewed and analyzed to determine the feasibility of using a combination of acid hydrolysis and CO2\x96C release during long-term incubation to determine soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and mean residence times (MRTs). Analysis of 1100 data points showed the SOC remaining after hydrolysis with 6 M HCl ranged from 30 to 80% of the total SOC depending on soil type, depth, texture, and management. Nonhydrolyzable carbon (NHC) in conventional till soils represented 48% of SOC; no-till averaged 56%, forest 55%, and grassland 56%. Carbon dates showed an average of 1200 yr greater MRT for the NHC fraction than total SOC. Long-term incubation, involving measurement of CO2 evolution and curve fitting, measured active and slow pools. Active-pool C comprised 2 to 8% of the SOC with MRTs of days to months; the slow pool comprised 45 to 65% of the SOC and had MRTs of 10 to 80 yr. Comparison of field 14C and 13C data with hydrolysis\x96incubation data showed a high correlation between independent techniques across soil types and experiments. There were large differences in MRTs depending on the length of the experiment. Insertion of hydrolysis\x96incubation derived estimates of active (Ca), slow (Cs), and resistant pools (Cr) into the DAYCENT model provided estimates of daily field CO2 evolution rates. These were well correlated with field CO2 measurements. Although not without some interpretation problems, acid hydrolysis\x96laboratory incubation is useful for determining SOC pools and fluxes especially when used in combination with associated measurements."

Population trends over time were summarized for ii species of resident coccinellids before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. In addition, annual population increase, habitat utilization patterns, and within-season population fluctuation for H. axyridis were analyzed H. axyridis became a dominant coccinellid species in the landscape 4 yr after its arrival. Adults of this species were found in all habitats monitored, including early secondary succession, poplar plantation, alfalfa, soybean, corn, and winter wheat. Significant population peaks were observed early and late in the season, depending on the habitat. Resident species that appear affected by the establishment of H. axyridis are Brachiacantha ursina (F.), Cycloneda munda (Say), and Chilocorus stigma (Say). However, to attribute the decline on the numbers of those species to H. axyridis will require further assessment. "

  abstract: "The degree to which soil resource availability is linked to patterns of microbial activity and plant productivity within ecosystems has important consequences for our understanding of how ecosystems are structured and for the management of systems for agricultural production. We studied this linkage in a 48-ha site in southwest Michigan, USA, that had been cultivated and planted to row crops for decades. Prior to seeding the site to genetically identical soybean plants (Glycine max) in early spring, we removed soil samples from approximate to 600 locations; plant biomass was harvested from these same locations later in the season. Soil samples were analyzed for physical properties (texture, bulk density), chemical properties (moisture, pH, total C, total N, inorganic N), and biological attributes (microbial biomass, microbial population size, respiration potential, and nitrification and N-mineralization potentials). Plant analyses included biomass and C and N contents. Soil resource variability across this long-cultivated site was remarkably high, as was variability in microbial activity and primary productivity. In almost all cases variability exhibited a strong spatially explicit structure: for most properties and processes &gt;50% of sample variance was spatially dependent at a scare of 5-60 m. Exceptions included microtopography, soil pH, and inorganic P, which were spatially dependent across the entire 1-1200 m range of separation distances examined in this study, and the culturable-bacteria population, which was not spatially autocorrelated at any scale examined. Both topographic relief and soil pH exhibited strongly nested structures, with autocorrelation occurring within two (topography) or more (pH) distinct ranges. Multiple regression analysis showed surprisingly little correlation between biological processes (soybean productivity, soil N turn-over, soil respiration), and static soil properties. The best predictor of soybean biomass at late reproductive stages (r(2) = 0.42) was a combination of nitrate N, bulk density, inorganic P, N-mineralization rates, and pH. Overall, results suggest a remarkable degree of spatial variability for a pedogenically homogeneous site that has been plowed and cropped mostly as a single field for &gt;100 yr. Such variability is likely to be generic to most ecosystems and should be carefully evaluated when making inferences about ecological relationships in these systems and when considering alternative sampling and management strategies.

  abstract: "Ergosterol is a sterol common to many fungi and may be useful for estimating fungal biomass in soil. Our objective was to compare three different methods for extracting ergosterol from soil. These included: (i) a published method that involves extraction with methanol, saponification with KOH, and separation with hexane before analysis using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC); (ii) a recently published supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method; and (iii) a simplified extraction method developed in our laboratory that is similar to method (i) but requires 80 to 90% less reagents. Similar quantities of ergosterol were extracted from both prairie and cropland soil with method (i) and with simplified method (iii). In contrast, the SFE method (ii) did not recover naturally occurring ergosterol from soil. Extraction effciencies of ergosterol standards added to soil were between 75 and 88% for the three procedures, with coefficients of variation of &lt;15% for all methods. Our simplified method substantially reduced cost, extraction time, and chemical waste per sample. Results of this study indicate that the simplified method was the most efficient technique for extraction of ergosterol from soil. "

  title: 
  abstract: "A key issue in ecology is how patterns of species diversity differ as a function of scale. The scaling function is the species-area curve. The form of the species-area curve results from patterns of environmental heterogeneity and species dispersal, and may be system-specific. A central concern is how, for a given set of species, the species-area curve varies with respect to a third variable, such as latitude or productivity. Critical is whether the relationship is scale-invariant (i.e. the species-area curves for different levels of the third variable are parallel), rank-invariant (i.e. the curves are non-parallel, but non-crossing within the scales of interest) or neither, in which case the qualitative relationship is scale-dependent. This recognition is critical for the development and testing of theories explaining patterns of species richness because different theories have mechanistic bases at different scales of action. Scale includes four attributes: sample-unit, grain, focus and extent. Focus is newly defined here. Distinguishing among these attributes is a key step in identifying the probable scale(s) at which ecological processes determine patterns. "

  abstract: "Nitrification potential is the maximum capacity of a soil's population of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH4+-N to NO3--N. Time of season and the effect of several management practices on nitrification potentials were measured via an amended slurry method, shaken for 24 h at 25 degreesC. Management strategies that reduce potential nitrification rates without limiting plant N uptake may increase the ratio of plant biomass to plant N content (PB:N), the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) per unit of N in ANPP, and decrease the amount of NO3- available for leaching, and/or conversion to N2O. Sites were located in Hickory Corners, MI, USA, on Haplic Luvisols. Management practices included: substitution of compost for N fertilizer, use of a rotation in place of continuous maize and the addition of cover crops. A previously tilled, successional grassland was used as a contrast to agricultural managements. Where N fertilizer was applied, nitrification potential increased in late May and again in late August-October. The seasonal pattern was similar but less pronounced where compost was applied. Nitrification rates were 4.2 times greater than that of the successional site when N fertilizer was applied. Use of N fertilizer increased nitrification potentials 1.5 times above treatments where compost was applied during 1998 and 1999 in the 6th and 7th years of the rotation. In some instances, nitrification potentials could be correlated with in situ NO3--N measurements. Average PB:Ns in the fertilizer management were greater or equivalent to the successional grassland site. Compost increased PB:N above that of N fertilizer. Utilization of compost decreased nitrification potentials, maintained yields, and increased PB:N. The crop N content was lower when compost was applied. Thus, grain and stover quality may be lowered and need to be monitored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. "

  abstract: "Forested ecosystems have been identified as potential C sinks. However, the accuracy of measurement and understanding of the underlying mechanisms for soil organic C (SOC) storage in forested ecosystems needs to be improved. The objective of this study was to use aggregate and soil organic matter (SOM) fractionation techniques to identify SOC pools that preferentially stabilize SOC in the long term and elucidate SOC sequestration mechanisms in forested soils. At two sites (Wildlife area, Ohio and Kemptville, Ontario) representing two different soils (Hapludalf and Hapludoll), we sampled soils under agriculture, afforestation, and forest and separated them into aggregates. Different size classes of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) fractions were isolated by density flotation, dispersion, and sieving. At both sites, aggregation and whole SOC content were greater in the forested than in the agricultural ecosystems. The greater aggregation in forested ecosystems resulted in greater iPOM C concentrations, especially the iPOM C fractions associated with microaggregates (53-250 mum) and microaggregates occluded within macroaggregates (mM) (250-2000 mum). The sum of C in these fractions (microaggregate protected C) was 468 +/- 29, 696 +/- 171, 673 +/- 70 g C m(-2) in the agricultural, afforested, and forested soils at Kemptville, respectively. The difference in the microaggregate protected C between the agricultural and the afforested soils accounted; on average, for 20% of the difference in whole SOC stocks between the soils. We conclude, SOC is stabilized for a relatively longer term within microaggregates formed in afforested and forest systems. Therefore, we suggest a new fractionation scheme to isolate this microaggregate associated SOC for assessing the impact of land use, land management, and climate change on C storage. "

  abstract: "Management practices that influence the quantity of C inputs returned to the soil from cropping systems and compost applications alter subsequent biotic activity broadly, contribute to seasonal fluctuations in nutrient dynamics, and may increase C sequestration. The effects of crop rotations and compost applications on soil-C sequestration and decompostion, and the turnover time of C-4-derived corn C were assessed via changes in the C content and C-13 values of particulate organic matter (POM) and total soil organic C (SCIC). The majority of organic inputs entered the POM fraction, defined as the sand-sized soil separates remaining on a 53-mum sieve after removal of residues (&gt;2 mm), dispersion in 5% sodium polyphosphate, and 12 h of shaking. Before the application of compost to soil, 85% of the C in the compost material was classified as PCIM. Measurements of POM-C in the soil were 45% higher and SOC was 16% greater where compost was applied in place of N fertilizer. Addition of compost to POM-C diminished the value of POM as an indicator of short-term changes in nutrient dynamics. However, POM-C remaining from compost applications made during the period 1993 to 1997 may be an indicator of enhanced macroaggregate stability: improved soil tilth and the retention of soil C and N. The turnover time of C4-derived C in the POM fraction was 11 years compared with 22 years in SOC. The presence of compost C did not affect the turnover time of corn-derived C. High cropping intensity and chisel plow management increased C sequestration relative to the preceding alfalfa management. "

  title: 
  abstract: The dynamics of soil seed banks in crop rotations of corn, soybean, and winter wheat were investigated to determine whether weed seed inputs associated with the winter wheat phases of the rotation were present in the readily germinable fraction of the seed bank in subsequent phases. Two studies were conducted, each in chisel-plowed systems. In one study, we compared seed banks in plots after 8 yr of corn grown continuously and with rotation that included winter wheat and soybean. A second study followed seed bank composition and abundance for 3 yr in plots that were planted to corn and soybean in successive years after planting to winter wheat. Seed banks were measured by direct germination in a heated greenhouse. In the first study, seed banks in plots planted to continuous corn (never planted to winter wheat) and the corn phase of the rotation (winter wheat planted 3 yr earlier) did not differ in species composition or abundance despite significant differences in seed banks in plots that had been planted to winter wheat the previous season. In the second study, seed bank abundance and composition in plots planted to winter wheat in 2001 rapidly changed after planting of corn and soybean in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Data from the two experiments suggest that seed banks in annual row crops experience rapid change in composition and abundance and can be strongly influenced by the most recent crop. This could limit our ability to infer longer term trends associated with changes in management practices from studies of soil seed banks

  title: 
  abstract: "Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of &gt;900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from &gt;60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As IN availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity.

  title: 
  abstract: "We examined the effects of living plant neighbors and litter on the performance of a native C-4 grass, Andropogon gerardi, at five old-field sites that differ in community biomass and soil fertility. We used plant removal experiments in which both living neighbors and litter were manipulated in a factorial arrangement of treatments over one growing season. Andropogon was added to treatment plots as seeds and as established transplants to examine the effects of the surrounding plant community on the recruitment and established phases of its life history.  Neighbors negatively affected Andropogon performance at all sites, indicating that resource exploitation by living plants was an important constraint to seedling recruitment and growth across the range of community biomass examined. Plant litter negatively affected recruitment at sites with the greatest community biomass, but had no effect on the growth of established transplants at any of the sites. The total effect of the surrounding plant community on recruitment was positively correlated with community biomass due to an increasing impact of plant litter. However, the total effect of the surrounding community on the growth of established transplants was unrelated to community biomass. The results suggest that it may be during the recruitment phase of the life history, when seeds and seedlings are especially susceptible to the effects of both litter and living neighbors, that Andropogon is most sensitive to variation in community biomass. Variation in the effects of litter on recruitment may be important in regulating plant species diversity and the distribution of native C-4 grasses along old-field biomass gradients in southwest Michigan.

  title: 
  abstract: A trait-based community assembly approach to weed management may enhance our understanding of how weed communities respond to specific management practices and increase the utility of weed management based on ecological principles. Therefore, identifying management practices that operate as assembly filters and the species traits upon which they act is an important first step in developing a more predictive weed science. Here, I report results from a 3-yr investigation of the effects of timing of annual tillage (spring vs. fall) on the annual assembly of arable weed communities. The timing of tillage had consistent and dramatic effects on the composition of weed communities; spring tillage led to weed communities dominated by early emerging spring annual forbs and C4 grasses, and fall tillage led to communities dominated by later-emerging forbs and C3 grasses. Traits determining a species' susceptibility to tillage time likely include germination syndrome and life cycle, both of which influence how species respond to changes in soil resource levels and light availability driven by seasonal disturbance regime. Manipulating the timing of tillage and other major soil disturbances may therefore be an important tool for managers interested in influencing community composition or targeting species with similar germination and life-history traits.

  abstract: "In a growing body of literature from a variety of ecosystems is strong evidence that various components of biodiversity have significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. However, much of this evidence comes from short-term, small-scale experiments in which communities are synthesized from relatively small species pools and conditions are highly controlled. Extrapolation of the results of such experiments to longer time scales and larger spatial scales-those of whole ecosystems-is difficult because the experiments do not incorporate natural processes such as recruitment limitation and colonization of new species. We show how long-term study of planned and accidental changes in species richness and composition suggests that the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning will vary over time and space. More important, we also highlight areas of uncertainty that need to be addressed through coordinated cross-scale and cross-site research. "

  title: 
  abstract: "We conducted a field experiment in a successional grassland to investigate the short-term effects of nitrogen enrichment and plant litter on plant species richness and on the establishment of a native grass (Andropogon gerardi) that was experimentally introduced to the study site as seed. Additions of nitrogen fertilizer to experimental plots over two growing seasons increased plant production as indicated by increases in both living plant biomass and litter biomass. Increased productivity reduced species richness by effectively preventing the seedling establishment of the subordinate forb species and reduced the recruitment of Andropogon gerardi by inhibiting both germination and survival. Litter removals carried out at each of two levels of nitrogen enrichment (no nitrogen, nitrogen added) showed that litter significantly reduced species richness by the same amount in fertilized and unfertilized plots, suggesting that living biomass and litter were purely additive, rather than interactive in their effects. In contrast, the results of litter additions suggested that the declines in richness associated with fertilization could largely be due to the suppressive effects of increased litter biomass alone. As a whole, the results indicate that litter and living biomass are largely substitutable in their inhibitory effects on species richness in highly productive successional grasslands due to their independent and equivalent capacities to attenuate light to very low levels. This study highlights the combined roles of competition and plant litter in influencing the diversity of grasslands through effects on seedling establishment. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Soil probably harbours most of our planet's undiscovered biodiversity. Recent results from both, culturing and nucleic acid-based approaches indicate that soil microbial diversity is even higher than previously imagined. One reason for the high diversity is that much of the diversity can be found at very small scales. If the same genotypes are not repeated at other locations, the large-scale diversity is greatly multiplied. It remains to be seen to what extent this large genotypic diversity actually affects functional diversity, microbial ecology, or biotechnological significance. Here we present a framework of methods for opening the soil black box that provides different levels of resolution of both microbial community structure and activity. The rationale for and examples of use of three of these methods are presented: guanine plus cytosine content of total soil DNA (G+C), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes amplified from soil DNA, and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of rRNA genes from soil DNA and from isolates. These methods give coarse and moderate scale resolution of the soil community The G+C method, which is one of the few comprehensive coarse scale methods, is also quantitative and can be used to separate DNA into G+C fractions for a second level of composition or activity analysis. The example of the ARDRA method used here illustrates that the same populations of 2,4-D degraders became dominant in three soils of very different land use history and that several of the 2,4-D degrading isolates from these sites had the same ARDRA pattern found from the soil DNA indicating that the isolates represent the dominant populations in the 2,4-D treated soil.

  abstract: "The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura is a new invasive pest of soybean in North America. We studied the ability of the existing predator community in soybean to reduce A. glycines establishment in field studies using either predator exclusion, open, or leaky cages that allowed aphid emigration but limited predation. Cages were infested with uniform initial densities of A. glycines adults and subsequent populations of aphids and predators were monitored over 24 h. The most abundant predators in these trials included the carabid beetles Elaphropus anceps (Le Conte), Clavina impressefrons Le Conte, Bembidion quadrimaculatum Say and spiders (Salticidae and Lycosidae). Foliar predators were less abundant and included; Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Coccinella septempunctata (L.), and Orius insidious (Say). Over the 2-year study, we found statistically significant predation on adult A. glycines in one out of six trials at 15 h and two out of six trials at 24 h. There was never significant evidence for predation of nymphs in any trial, however overall survival (adults + nymphs) was significantly reduced in one out of six trials at 15 h and three out of six trials at 24 h. Based on these results we suggest that generalist predators can be a significant but variable factor influencing the establishment of A. glycines populations in soybean. The impact of existing predator communities should be further investigated as a means of managing A. glycines populations in North American soybean production systems. "

  abstract: The concentration and d15N of nitrate in groundwater samples collected from two mid-Michigan lysimeters beneath farmland were determined on a weekly basis from March to November of 1993. The soil within one of the lysimeters was tilled and the other was not tilled. Nitrate concentrations in the samples from the tilled lysimeter were approximately twice those of the untilled lysimeter throughout the study. The nitrogen stable isotopic abundances varied similarly on a seasonal basis in the tilled and untilled lysimeters. The d15N values ranged between -3.9 0/00 in the spring to 9.4 0/00 in fall (September). An increasing trend in the d15N of nitrate from both lysimeters occurred from spring to late summer, that was likely the result of fractionation due to denitrification and mineralization of the less readily mineralizable organic fraction. A decrease in d15N was observed from the middle of September to a early November that reflected a decrease in the influence of microbial denitrification on the isotopic composition of nitrate.

  abstract: "The effect of disturbance on soil nematode communities was studied in eight treatments varying in intensity of human intervention at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site, Hickory Comers, MI. The agricultural treatments ranged from those manipulated with high chemical inputs and heavily impacted by human management to successional treatments that had no chemicals and little human impact. A canonical discriminant analysis of the nematode data separated the treatments into four systems: high chemical input (the conventional tillage and no tillage treatments, both corn/soybean rotations); organic (the low input and zero input treatments, both wheat/corn/soybean rotations); perennial (poplar and alfalfa treatments); successional (abandoned after tillage and never tilled treatments). Nematode abundance was highest in the high input and organic systems and lowest in the poplar treatment. Overall, bacterial feeding, plant parasitic and fungal feeding nematodes dominated the treatments. Species diversity was greatest in the successional treatments. The bacterial feeding trophic group and the modified Shannon index described differences at both the treatment and system levels, while the Shannon index demonstrated diversity at the system and annual and perennial crop level of analysis. Measures that detected differences (P&lt; 0.05) consistently across all treatments, systems, and annual vs. perennial crops were total abundance, the predator trophic group, the maturity index (MI) and the plant parasite index. The minimum analyses needed to detect disturbance reliably were a multivariate analysis and the MI. However, understanding and predicting the impact of the disturbance on the food web and ecosystem functioning would be increased with results from diversity indices and nematode functional groups. "

  title: Dynamics of Nitrogenous Gases in Agricultural and Forest Soils
  abstract: We are trying to develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationships betwen N<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub> flux from agricultural and forest soils. Both gases are products of denitrification but N<sub>2</sub>O is also a product of nitrification and perhaps other proceses. Our aproach is to aply <sup>15</sup>N-labeled material to soil, and then monitor production (or consumption) of N<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O in a soil cover headspace. N<sub>2</sub>O may be determined by gas chromatography (GC) or by isotope ratio mas spectrometry (IRMS). N<sub>2</sub>, however, may only be determined by mas spectrometry under these conditions. If only denitrifiers contribute to N-gas production, and if consumption of N-gas in soil is negligible, then the results of the two methods for N<sub>2</sub>O analysis should agre.Data colected over the last 16 months from agricultural soil (corn stuble, LTER bulk plots) and forest soil (deciduous, Long Wods) indicate that for N<sub>2</sub>O, fluxes measured by GC and IRMS rarely agre. Usualy IRMS values are much lower than GC values, which strongly sugests (for mathematical reasons) that flux derives from a non-uniformly labeled pol of soil mineral N. Sometimes GC values are lower than IRMS values, sugesting that significant consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O is co-ocuring with N<sub>2</sub>O production during the incubation.In April 19, fertilizer solution or water (control) was aded to 16 plots (4 treatments x 4 replicates) in Long Wods. In the main treatment, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrate (9%) was aded at a rate of 45 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> while unlabeled amonium was aded at a rate of 70 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup>. In one variant of the main treatment, amonium was labeled (9%) and nitrate was unlabeled. In another variant, labeled nitrate was aplied at a lower rate (4.5 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup>) but at the same enrichment. Incubations were conducted imediately after (~ 2 h) and 14 d after aditions. Samples were analyzed by GC and by IRMS.<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_1.htm">Figure 1</a> shows aparent enrichment of the soil mineral N pol for each incubation, infered from the distribution of mases of N<sub>2</sub>O in the sampled headspace. In most cases, IRMS flux values were les than GC flux values (<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_2_.htm">Figure 2</a>) indicating that the aparent enrichments are overestimates, perhaps representing only the labeled portion of a two-pol system. Stil, it apears that N<sub>2</sub>O from labeled amonium is present as early as two hours after adition, sugesting tightly coupled nitrification and denitrification in this soil. Enrichment of the soil N pol in labeled-nitrate plots was initialy similar to aded nitrate, but droped rapidly over a two-wek interval, probably due to dilution by nitrification. In contrast, enrichment of N<sub>2</sub>O in labeled-amonium plots rose with time. Probably most of this N<sub>2</sub>O was produced by denitrification of soil nitrate which was continualy being enriched by nitrification of the amonium pol. Not surprisingly, enrichment droped more rapidly for plots with low rates of labeled nitrate aplication than for plots with high rates of labeled nitrate aplication. The overestimation represented by flux ratios greater than 1 (<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_2_.htm">Figure 2</a>) may be an artifact of reduced analytical sensitivity due to very low enrichment in these plots.

  title: 
  abstract: A number of experiments have addressed how increases in nitrogen availability increase the productivity and decrease the diversity of plant communities. We lack, however, a rigorous mechanistic understanding of how changes in abundance of particular species combine to produce changes in community productivity and diversity. Single experiments cannot provide insight into this issue because each species occurs only once per experiment, and each experiment is conducted in only one location; thus, it is impossible from single experiments to determine whether responses of particular species are consistent across environments or dependent on the particular environmental context in which the experiment was conducted. To address this issue, we assembled a dataset of 20 herbaceous species that were each represented in at least 6 different fertilization experiments and tested whether responses were general across experiments. Of the 20 species, one consistently increased in relative abundance and five consistently decreased across replicate experiments. A partially-overlapping group of 8 species displayed responses to nitrogen that varied predictably among experiments as a function of geographic location, neighboring species, or a handful of other community characteristics (ANPP, precipitation, species richness, relative abundance of focal species in control plots, and community composition). Thus, despite modest replication and a limited number of predictor variables, we were able to identify consistent patterns in response of 10 out of 20 species across multiple experiments. We conclude that the responses of individual species to nitrogen addition are often predictable, but that in most cases these responses are functions of the abiotic or biotic environment. Thus, a rigorous understanding of how plant species respond to nitrogen addition will have to consider not only the traits of individual plant species, but also aspects of the communities in which those plants live.

    Modeling SOM Dynamics and

  abstract: |-
    Modeling SOM Dynamics and
    Management: Decision Making in an Enriched CO2
    EnvironmentAs part of an &lsquo;LTER
    spinoff&rsquo; project, funded by DOE, we are conducting field and
    modeling work to support improved quantification of soil C changes
    in ecosystems influenced by present and/or past agricultural
    practices. The focus of the project is: a) to collect and analyze
    soil C from forest successional systems on abandoned agricultural
    soils, using adjacent never-tilled forest sites and permanent
    agricultural sites as references, together with SOM fractionation,
    natural abundance 13C and 14C dating, and b)
    to develop key databases for regional extrapolation of soil C
    dynamics and to improve models of SOM response to management and
    vegetational changes, using fractionation and isotopic studies from
    the field sites and from previously investigated agricultural
    sites. Objectives, progress and outlook are presented for the
    second objective only.We are estimating historical
    productivity data for ca. 20 long-term agricultural field sites in
    the central US by augmenting site records with county-average crop
    yields obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service,
    US Agricultural Census and state-level records. Data obtained to
    date go back as far as 1917, but in most cases digital data are
    available from state sources only from about 1940 and nationally
    (NASS) since 1971. Data not available in digital form are being
    collected from printed reports. Initially we are focussing on
    counties corresponding to the long-term experiments, for which we
    will compare county-average and experiment station yields to
    develop correlations and derive &lsquo;best estimates&rsquo;of
    long-term trends for the pre-experimental period at each site. To
    estimate annual C inputs to soil, an extensive analysis of
    literature data has been used to derive a set of crop specific
    (which are time dependent to account for genetic improvements)
    functions relating grain yield to above-ground residue and root
    production. The yield data and C partitioning functions will first
    be used to estimate time series of historical C inputs for modeling
    SOM dynamics at the field sites (see below). Subsequently we will
    use the NASS yield data (1971-present) and the partitioning
    functions to estimate the quantify and trends of C inputs,
    nationally, as part of a larger effort to estimate the C balance
    for US agricultural soils.The objectives for site specific
    modeling of SOM dynamics is to evaluate to what extent measured
    &lsquo;pools&rsquo; of SOM, i.e. from aerobic incubation, acid
    hydrolysis and 14C dating, can be closely approximated
    by conceptual model pools and how general this correspondence is
    across differing climates, soil types and management regimes. A
    modeling framework, TRACE_C, has been developed to test alternative
    model structures and assumptions and to simulate C isotope dynamics
    in addition to total C and SOM pools dynamics. The model uses
    measured/estimated C inputs (see above) and climate data as the
    primary driving variables. Results so far from several sites show
    relatively good correspondence between measured and modeled total
    organic C and 13C signatures for the total soil, in both
    native and cultivated sites, using the default model structure.
    Model estimates of quantity and 13C for a
    &lsquo;resistant&rsquo; C were much less consistent with the
    attributes of the non-acid hydrolyzable fractions.Future work will focus on
    application of the model across all sites using the composite
    estimates of historical C inputs, evaluation of alternative model
    &lsquo;hypotheses&rsquo; (i.e. formulations )-- with comparisons of
    total C, analytical &lsquo;pools&rsquo;,and total soil
    13C, C mineralization rates and
    13CO2 signatures from long-term aerobic
    incubations -- and testing/adaptation of the model for forest and
    reforested soils investigated within the project.

However, most microbial ecology studies of the rhizoplane alow living rots to develop in soil for at least 4-5 days before sampling since it is generaly though that very young rots are not suficiently developed to select a microbial comunity. Inded, litle is known of the very first comunity of microrganisms that colonize rots grown in soil. The goal of this project is therefore to define the comunity ecology of the pioner rhizobacteria that colonize rots of white clover (a nodulated, endomycorhizal legume) and spring canola (a non-nodulated, non-mycorhizal brasica) during the first 2 days of germination in a sandy loam soil from an LTER site at KBS. These rhizoplane comunities are compared to the pioner comunity that colonizes tothpicks (a non-viable wody substratum control) buried in the same soil.Plating experiments on 10% standard plate count/cyclohexamide agar and soil extract/glucose/cyclohexamide agar indicate that the culturable pioner comunities (CFU/mg rot dry wt) colonize each of the 3 substrata with similar, initial doubling rates (~ 3 hrs doubling time). However, the duration of exponential growth was 3-5 times longer on the true rhizoplanes, resulting in 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup>-fold higher comunity densities at 2 days, consistent with their greater resource alocation.Cluster analyses of quantitative celular FAME data from 626 numericaly dominant culturable isolates indicated 60 distinct FAME profiles, only 4% of which clustered. Thus, the pioner rhizobacterial comunities that developed on white clover, canola, and tothpicks were very diverse, contrary to the ecological characteristic that pioner comunities generaly have low diversity dominated by just a few species. Further cluster analyses indicated that the structures of each of these pioner culturable comunities were distinct and changed over the 2 day period. A subset of 106 isolates is being analyzed by ARDRA, BIOLOG, and FISH (using group-specific 16SrRNA fluorescent probes) to further ases the diversity, nutritional versatility and phylogeny of these culturable pioner comunities. In adition, T-RFLP analyses are being done on whole rhizoplane comunities of clover, canola, and tothpicks sampled at 1 &amp; 2 days. These ongoing tests should further indicate the dynamics and diversity of microbial comunities during pioner colonization of rots, their extent of habitat-selectivity, evidence of ecological sucesion during pioner colonization of the rhizoplane, and which bacteria first colonize rots in soil.We also plan to perform computer-asisted microscopy to learn more about the <i>in situ</i> spatial relationships of pioner rhizobacterial colonization of rots growing in soil. Two major inovative developments have ben made to facilitate this work. First, we have developed improved protocols to dislodge soil from rots so that &gt;80% of the rhizoplane can be visualized by scaning electron microscopy and laser scaning confocal microscopy. Second, we have developed new computer-asisted microscopy software, caled CMEIAS\xA9 (for Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System), tailored to studies of <i>in situ</i> comunity microbial ecology. These wil be used to quantitate the morphological diversity, abundance (numbers, biovolume, biomas C, biosurface area), and spatial relationships (spatial density, % cover, nearest neighbor distribution, and centroid <i>x,y </i>cordinates to compute<i> </i>semivariogram autocorelation and krieging density maps via GS+ Geostatistics) of the pioner rhizobacterial comunities developing on rots grown in soil. This information wil significantly enhance our understanding of the diversity, dynamics and ecological sucesion of pioner rhizobacterial comunities on a spatial scale relevant to the microrganisms themselves."

  abstract: |-
    Many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain coexistence among plant species.&nbsp; Spatial heterogeneity in soil resources at scales smaller than individual plants may promote coexistence by forcing a trade-off between the efficient locating of nutrient patches (scale foraging) and the efficient exploiting of nutrient patches (precision foraging).&nbsp; Evidence from Campbell et al. (1991) suggests that dominant species use a scale foraging strategy whereas subordinate species use a precision foraging strategy.
    To test whether dominant and subordinate species differed in foraging strategy under heterogeneous soil resource conditions, I conducted a series of greenhouse experiments in which I varied patch size and intensity, using two dominant (Bromus inermis and Solidago canadensis) and three subordinate (Achillea millefolium, Rumex acetosella, and Silene latifolia) herbaceous perennial species commonly found in local old fields.&nbsp; One of the dominant species (Bromus) consistently had high tissue nitrogen content, but had lower nitrogen contents as patch size and nutrient intensity decreased.&nbsp; This performance pattern was consistent with that expected for a scale forager.&nbsp; the other dominant species (Solidago) and the three subordinate species had lower nitrogen contents overall, but more consistent nitrogen contents across patch sizes and nutrient intensities.&nbsp; This performance pattern was consistent with that expected for a precision forager.&nbsp; There appeared to be a trade-off between the ability to acquire a large amount of nitrogen and the ability to maintain constant acquisition levels in the plant as nutrient patch sizes changed.
    I also predicted that precision and scale-foraging species would differ in the mechanisms they used to respond to nutrient heterogeneity.&nbsp; Although I found differences among species with respect to which response mechanisms they used, the differences were not related to precision vs. scale foraging strategies.&nbsp; Two of the four precision-foraging species, Achillea and Solidago, ubcreased their branching density in nutrient patches.&nbsp; All species were able to selectively allocate root biomass to nutrient enriched pot quadrants.&nbsp; None of these species changed root system topology in response to nutrient patches.&nbsp; Rumex and Silene, two of the precision-foraging species, adjusted nitrogen uptake so that root nitrogen concentrations were constant across patch sizes.&nbsp; Bromus (a scale forager), Achillea and Solidago (precision foragers) adjusted nitrogen uptake so that root concentrations in enriched pot quadrants were higher than in background quadrants.&nbsp; These five species did not differ in the patch size or nutrient intensity at which they used a response mechanism.
    To fully understand the role that nutrient heterogeneity may play in determining plant community structure, we must also know the size, intensity and frequency of small scale patches in the environment.&nbsp; Spatial sampling and geostatistical analysis techniques are useful tools for quantifying spatial variation of nutrients in the field, but it is unclear what spatial sampling pattern will be most sensitive to multiple scales of heterogeneity.&nbsp; Using computer simulated data and semivariance analysis, I determined that a stratified-nested grid sampling regime would be more sensitive than a random or stratified grid sampling regime when determining the magnitude and scale of environmental heterogeneity across several sites.

  title: Designing an Agroecosystem to Eficiently Manage Soil N Pols for Agronomic and Environmental Benefit
  abstract: "Management strategies that are sustainable must provide yields equivalent to conventional agronomic systems, decrease environmental polutants such as NO<sub>3</sub>, and increase the amount of plant available N in synchrony with crop uptake. Management practices that included crop rotations and compost change the flow of N in the active and slow soil pols on both a seasonal and long-term basis. Nitrification potential, the maximum capacity of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH<sub>4</sub> to NO<sub>3</sub>, depends upon comunity-population size and composition, as wel as, abiotic controls. It is sensitive to short-term changes in management practices such as crop rotations, compost or fertilizer aditions, and cover crops. High nitrification rates often result in NO<sub>3</sub> los to groundwater and increased N<sub>2</sub>O emisions. Substitution of compost for N fertilizer decreased nitrification rates by 25% without reducing yield. First year corn yields (averaged acros cover crop treatment) were 68 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> on N fertilizer plots and 70.8 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> on compost plots at Hickory Corners, MI in 198. The rotation consisted of the folowing crops: corn (Zea mays L.)/ corn,/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum). Nitrification rates in 1<sup>st</sup> year corn (20 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) were greater than those of continuous corn (167 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Cover crop treatments had higher seasonal nitrification potentials (190 vs. 176 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Nitrification potentials on agronomic treatments peaked in October. The sucesional grasland treatment peaked in April. Low nitrification potentials apear to be indicative of both agronomic and unmanaged ecosystems that cycle N eficiently and experience les N los. Crop rotations and compost aplications caused long-term changes in soil N pols. The initial size of the pol of mineralizable organic N (N<sub>0</sub>) from a 150 d incubation significantly increased from 194 to 198 (47 vs. 70 g N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil N) on compost plots. The amount of N<sub>0</sub> did not fluctuate after 4 yr of N fertilizer aplications, 42 vs. 4 g N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil N. The mean residence time (MRT) increased in both treatments. Average MRT in April of 194 on compost treatments was 246 d and had increased to 768 d by April of 198. The average MRT on N fertilizer plots was 273 d in 194 and 47 d in 198. Lower initial mean residence times in both treatments during 194 may be due in part to the 6 yr of alfalfa production prior to implementation of the rotation in 193. The N<sub>0</sub> pol does not apear to have reached a steady state under compost management. The compost system has ben shown to cycle N more eficiently than the N fertilizer system on a seasonal and long-term basis. The active pol of N under compost management is smaler but suficient for plant neds and is in a les volatile form than in the fertilizer system. In the compost system, N equivalent to N<sub>0</sub> is predicted to become available for crop uptake in June of 20.

    Poplar Root System Responses to
    Defoliation by Gypsy Moths
  abstract: |-
    Defoliation is predicted to lead to a strong
    increase in carbon allocation to leaf regrowth, at the expense of
    carbon allocation to root growth, root carbon stores, and perhaps
    nutrient acquisition. We tested this hypothesis in four replicate
    stands of hybrid poplars (Populus x euramericana cv
    Eugenii) on the Kellogg Biological Station LTER site, with a
    control and defoliated treatment in each block. We moved gypsy moth
    egg masses and insects off the control treatments and into the
    defoliated treatments, and achieved large differences between
    levels of defoliation in the two treatments in 1997. Early summer
    root production (May to July) and total nonstructural carbohydrates
    (TNC) in fine roots sampled at peak leaf regrowth were strongly
    reduced in the defoliated treatment compared to the control
    treatment. These changes in root growth and root carbon stores are
    consistent with a shift in carbon allocation away from roots and
    towards leaf regrowth following defoliation.

  title: 
  abstract: "Arbuscular mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of vascular plants.&nbsp; Part of this dissertation is devoted to analyzing the fatty acid and sterols of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Sorghum with the aim of identifying universal molecular markers of mycorrhizal infection.&nbsp; The mycorrhizal fungi contain high amounts of unusual lipids that may be used to mark their presence in infected roots.&nbsp; My results show that phosopholipid fatty acid 16:1, as well as campesterol are molecules that can be used to consistently identify mycorrhizal infection.&nbsp; In addition, lipid profiles may provide insight as to which fungal species is present in the roots.\n\
    In a second experiment, the fatty acids and sterols of several isolates of root pathogenic fungi were surveyed to assess the taxonomic value of lipid profiles.&nbsp; My results show that the genera Rhizoctonia and Pythium can be reliably identified because of their characteristic lipid composition.&nbsp; \n\
    Another question that I address in this work is:&nbsp; What is the C turnover time of mycorrhizal lipids?&nbsp; For this purpose, I carried out a pulse-chase experiment in which I followed the incorporation and subsequent turnover of C in mycorrhizal lipids.&nbsp; Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants were subjected to a pulse exposure to 14CO2followed by sequential harvesting.&nbsp; Infected plants assimilated more 14C than non-mycorrhizal plants, and had a higher absolute and percentage allocation of 14C to root tissue, below ground respiration, and soil.&nbsp; Despite the increased fixation of C by mycorrhizal plants, mycorrhizal shoots had reduced biomass.&nbsp; This indicates that the C drain imposed by the results in a reduced shoot growth, suggesting that the mycorrhizal fungus was acting as a parasite.&nbsp; The pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that the lipids of mycorrhizal roots are a dynamic pool of C with measurable turnover of 14C.&nbsp; The C turnover time of the mycorrhizal fatty acid 16:1 w 5 was calculated at 210 h-1.&nbsp; The lipids of non-mycorrhizal roots incorporated less radiolabel, underscoring the difference in the lipid C cycle between the arbuscular mycorrhizae and non-mycorrhizal roots.&nbsp; To my knowledge, this is the first measurement of the C turnover of a biomass component of the mycorrhizal fungus.

    Structure Changes Following a Change in Vegetative

    Microbial Community
    Structure Changes Following a Change in Vegetative
    CoverMicrobial diversity of soil is
    extremely high, and most of this diversity cannot be cultured. To
    compare soil samples for their microbial community composition
    total genomic DNA of bacteria can be studied. Since the base
    composition of DNA differs among bacterial genera a community
    profile based on the guanine and cytosine concentration (%G+C) in
    the extracted DNA from soil can be made. The resulting profile is
    based on the relative abundance of DNA of different G+C
    composition, and creates a fingerprint of the community composition
    (Holben and Harris, 1991). This is an approximation of the
    microbial diversity at the genus level.The complex mixture of bacterial
    genomes is qualitatively and quantitatively characteristic of the
    microbial community. Therefore, community shifts can be represented
    in the overall DNA based community profile. The range of bacterial
    %G+C is from 24% (Clostridum and Mycoplasma) to 76%
    (Oerskoviae). Phylogentically coherent species have not more
    than 3% difference, and the species of a genus are not expected to
    differ by more than 10% (Stackebrandt and W. Liesack,
    1993).We studied the effect of a change
    in vegetative cover of a Hawaiian soil from forest to pasture. DNA
    was extracted from both soils and compared by the abundance of its
    guanine and cytosine (G+C) composition. A gradient of %G+C
    concentration was then established by equilibrium density gradient
    ultracentrifugation, and 0.2 ml fractions were collected by a
    fraction collector. The G+C profile of soil DNA was shifted to
    significantly higher G+C DNA with the change from forest to pasture
    (Fig. 1) which indicates
    significant changes in the composition of the soil bacterial
    community.The majority of soil DNA was in
    the 55% to 70% G+C range for both soils but the major peak was 61%
    G+C for the forest soil DNA and 67% G+C for the pasture soil. The
    pasture soil community exhibited an additional peak in the 42 to
    45% G+C range, and displayed a small peak of 71% G+C. DNA extracted
    from replicate soil samples showed repeated profiles such that
    within site variation was much less than differences between the
    two sites (Fig. 1). The standard deviations of the mean curve
    differences for the forest and pasture soil communities were small,
    s = 0.14 and s = 0.27, respectively.Evidence from
    3H-labeling experiments and G+C based fractionation of
    soil community DNA indicates that activity and growth are not
    confined to a small fraction of the bacterial biomass but are
    widespread amongst the genera represented in the profile (Harris,
    1994).The G+C based fractionation of
    soil extracted DNA yielded community profiles specific for each
    soil site and of the entire soil microbial community that can be
    compared, and allows the selective analysis of soil community
    subsets. In addition to lowering diversity to a more manageable
    level, the G+C separation step is also a means to detect less
    dominant organisms in a community. The reliability of this
    technique could be shown through statistical comparisons of
    repetitive experiments. The G+C method provides an analysis at a
    coarser level of taxon distinction but is comprehensive for
    all DNA. This method becomes especially powerful when
    combined with other DNA based techniques such as 16S rRNA clone
    library analysis.

  abstract: "Late-summer starch accumulation in fine roots of poplars (Populus x canadensis Moench.) defoliated by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) lagged behind that in fine roots of undefoliated trees. If starch concentration declines with age, defoliation-induced changes in root system age structure could be partly responsible for this difference. To test this hypothesis, we measured fine-root starch and soluble sugar concentrations in roots of known age from trees in defoliated and undefoliated plots. There was a significant interaction between the effects of defoliation and root type (white, brown, or dead) on fine root soluble sugar concentration because of the high concentration of soluble sugars in white roots from trees in undefoliated plots. Both root starch and soluble sugar concentrations were variable among individuals of each age class. The population frequency distributions for starch and soluble sugar concentrations were both right-skewed, and fit by exponential functions. These data are most consistent with direct defoliation effects on a labile and dynamic pool of carbohydrates in poplar fine roots, rather than indirect defoliation effects on root system age structure.

  abstract: Yellow sticky traps and quadrat observations or hand collected samples were used to examine the temporal and spatial distribution, and sex ratio of Coccinella septempunctata L. (C7) summer adults. C7 was univoltine, with activity starting in March, eggs and larvae produced in May and early June, and summer adults emerging in mid-June. Emigration to hibernation sites most likely occurred during late July and August. None of the weather factors measured were consistently associated with C7 activity. C7 showed a clumped spatial distribution in traps which was probably due to the attractiveness of traps. A random distribution in quadrats was accepted because there is no biological reason for interaction between individuals during summer. Sex ratio of hand-collected beetles was 1:1. A slight change in sex ratio in traps occurred during late summer. Males were captured on traps more often at the end of July and early August, and more females were captured later.

    Induced-Resistance in Poplars to Gypsy Moth Defoliation:
    Effects on Early, Mid-, and Late-Season Leaf Feeding
    Lepidoptera.
  abstract: |-
    I examined the effects of an experimentally
    created gypsy moth outbreak on the phytochemistry of hybrid
    poplars. Defoliation significantly increased total phenolics and
    condensed tannins, products of secondary pathways thought to confer
    resistance to herbivores. Gypsy moth performance was reduced when
    fed leaves from defoliated plots. In addition, the performance of
    other contemporaneous insect herbivores was significantly altered
    when fed leaves damaged by gypsy moth feeding, but not always in a
    consistent pattern.

  abstract: "Changes in soil C as a result of changes in management are relatively slow, and several years of experimentation are needed before differences in management practices can be detected using traditional statistical procedures such as randomized complete block design (RCBD). Using spatial analyses (SA) that take into account spatial variability between plots has a potential for faster and more efficient detection of soil C differences. We hypothesize that for variables with strong spatial continuity, such as total soil C, accurate spatial variability assessment can be obtained even in relatively small experiments. Thus, SA can significantly improve the statistical efficiency of even these experiments. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by comparing performances of RCBD analysis and SA for simulated small-sized experiments where soil C is the response variable. Total soil C data collected from 11 field sites at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) experiment in Michigan were used as an input for simulated experiments. Performance of SA depended on the strength of spatial correlation in soil C and was found to be related to topographical diversity of the experimental sites. In the sites with more diverse topography and stronger spatial correlation of soil C the SA produced lower standard errors for treatment means than those of the RCBD analysis (8 out of 11 sites).

  title: 
  abstract: Nitrite leaching reflects poor nutrient retention, poses a hazard to public health and a challenge to solute transport theory. Field observations and numerical simulation of soil-plant interactions are integrated to identify sensitivity of simulated nitrate leaching to errors in predicted root function. Seasonal changes in maize root distributions, canopy development, and gradients in soil water content and carbon dioxide partial pressures were quantified in 1990 and 1991 during water deficits in a field lysimeter under an irrigated, rain shelter. Seasonal changes in these parameters and in soil mineral and leached N were determined during 1991 in four field lysimeters subjected to conventional or no-till crop culture. Horizontal and vertical gradients in root intersections with 0.05 (I.D.) x 1.4 m polybutyrate tubes corresponded with transient deficits in plant water supply, and subsequent root proliferation during mid-vegetative growth stages. A horizontal complement to the vertical rooting front is characterized by exponential distributions of inter-root distances under a row crop. Geostatistical measures of clustered root distributions indicate spatial correlation up to 0.45 m at anthesis. Failure to consider depth-dependent gradients in root xylem potential most likely accounts for systematic bias in soil water depletion predicted by a simplified solution to a cylindrical model of root water uptake., Soil plus root respiration is related to vertical root distributions, but vertical gradients in C02 and C02 flux fail to satisfy conditions for the steady state assumption. Increased N03-N retention in conventional till soil, relative to no-till soil indicates solute partitioning among mobile and immobile regions of soil water may be modified by historic tillage effects. Deviations in N03-N concentrations of leachate from seasonal trends coincide with extreme high or low drainage flux conditions, invalidating assumptions of homogeneous pore velocities and solute concentrations. Simulated N03-N leaching rates are sensitive to errors in predicted infiltration, canopy dimensions and drainage below the root zone, but are insensitive to reductions in maximum root length density. Managing soil-plant interactions for optimal productivity and solute retention requires accurate simulation of system behaviour when regulation shifts from atmospheric boundary conditions to soil system transport and transformation processes.

  title: 
  abstract: "The hypothesis that soil light fraction and heavy fraction harbor distinct eubacterial communities and have differing numbers and sizes of bacterial cells was tested in three agronomic cropping systems. This hypothesis would imply that these soil fractions are distinct microbial habitats. Shoot residue and rhizosphere soil were also included in the analysis. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S ribosomal DNA was used to assay eubacterial community structure. T-RFLP profiles were affected by both soil fraction and cropping system, accounting for 35&ndash;50% of the variance in the profiles. T-RFLP profiles separated samples into two distinct eubacterial habitats: soil heavy fraction, which includes the mineral particles and associated humified organic matter, and soil light fraction/shoot residue and rhizosphere, which includes particulate soil organic matter. Differences were not based on organic C content of fractions alone; T-RFLP profiles were also differentiated by cropping system and by rhizosphere versus light fraction/shoot residue. Heavy fraction communities had the least amount of random variability in T-RFLP profiles, resulting in the clearest cropping system effects, while rhizosphere and shoot residue communities were the most variable. Profiles from organically managed corn soil were more variable than for either conventionally managed corn or alfalfa. The log number of bacterial cells per gram fraction was affected by soil fraction but not cropping system, being highest in the light fraction. The percentage of cells &gt;0.18 &mu;m3 was also greater in the light fraction than in other fractions. While bacterial cell density was generally correlated with C content of the soil fraction, heavy fraction did have a significantly greater number of cells per &mu;g C than other soil fractions. The results show that habitat diversity in soil, related both to the amounts and types of organic matter, as well as other potential factors, are important in maintaining the high soil bacterial species diversity and evenness that is found in soil.

    Overview of the
    SALUS (Systems Approach to Land Use Sustainability) Model
    Development
  abstract: |-
    The SALUS model is designed to
    simulate agroecosystem dynamics, including plant growth and
    development, soil water and heat flux and soil organic matter and
    nutrient fluxes, over short (growing season) to medium (several
    decades) time horizons. Its development was prompted by the need
    for an improved analysis of ecosystem responses to management and
    climate perturbations in complex cropping systems, including the
    opportunity to simulate many "non-conventional" management regimes.
    A major objectives has been to combine the attributes of
    daily-based functional crop growth models (e.g. CERES) with those
    of detailed biogeochemical models (e.g. Century) in order to
    represent both fine-scale, within season variability in plant,
    water and nutrient dynamics as well as longer-term feedbacks
    between management, soil characteristics and productivity. The
    project is a collaboration between investigators at Michigan State
    University (MSU) and Colorado State University (CSU).The model was written in
    Fortran-90, which affords a number of technical advantages
    including better &lsquo;encapsulation&rsquo; of program components,
    availability of complex data structures and explicit pointers and
    dynamic memory allocation. These attributes facilitate a more
    modular design compared to Fortran-77 based models and dynamic
    memory allocation allows several cropping systems to be run
    simultaneously, for example, spatially distributed applications
    linked through GIS.Major enhancement over antecedent
    models (CERES, Century) include multi-year simulations of crop
    growth using generic structures parameterized for specific species
    and varieties, a &lsquo;full&rsquo; plant C balance including root
    turnover, exudation and respiration, simulation of soil organic
    matter and nutrient turnover through the entire profile,
    &lsquo;time-to-ponding&rsquo; concepts to represent effects of
    within day variability of precipitation intensity effects on runoff
    and water balance, and an enhanced set of management options. A
    prototype graphical program has been developed to manipulate and
    plot model output.The model is currently running on
    UNIX, PC and Mac platforms. Model testing is underway, utilizing a
    variety of data from the KBS-LTER and other data from KBS
    experiments. We plan to complete this first comprehensive testing
    of the model in 1998, to be followed by submission of a paper
    describing and documenting the model, and additional collaborative
    papers using the model for interpretation and analysis of data from
    the LTER and other KBS experiments. Following completion of these
    analysis, we will conduct a cross-site application of the model for
    a set of long-term agricultural field experiments across the US to
    investigate interactions between management, crop growth and soil
    organic matter dynamics. Future objectives on which limited work
    has begun include incorporation of phosphorus dynamics and
    development of a user-friendly graphical user interface.SALUS Modeling

  title: 
  abstract: "Annual crop fields typically are simple habitats dominated by a few plant species where pesticides play a major role in managing weed and insect infestations. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential to reduce reliance on pesticides by manipulating plant species and communities to benefit natural enemies of insects and weeds. Such efforts aim to enhance natural enemy impact by providing appropriate food, shelter, and hosts, and efforts typically are accomplished by manipulation of plant species, populations, or communities. Habitat management is generally viewed as an important factor in maintaining stable insect and natural enemy populations in agricultural systems and may have a similar function in increasing weed seed predation. Crop and noncrop habitats provide resources to natural enemies either directly through floral nectar and Pollen, indirectly by increased host or prey availability, or through emergent properties of the habitat such as by moderating the microclimate. These critical resources for natural enemies can be provided in agricultural ecosystems at several scales: within fields, at field margins, or as a component of the larger landscape. Because individual natural enemy species may require quite specific resources at different times and spatial scales, not all attempts to manipulate habitat diversity are equally effective. We review the role of plant resources, including weeds, in supporting natural enemy communities and provide case studies of how varying plant diversity at different spatial scales can influence the effectiveness of biological control in agricultural landscapes.

  abstract: |-
    The effect of long term 2,4-D selection on the microbial community and its impact on nutrient transformation was studied in the field and microcosms.&nbsp; 2,4-D was applied at (0X which is the control), the normal field rate of 1.1 kg/ha (1X), 10X and 100X the normal field rate for ten years.&nbsp; The microbial community was analyzed by cultural methods, reverse sample genome probing (RSGP) and functional gene probing.&nbsp; RSGP showed that the microbial community in the 100X plots had been altered such that there was an enrichment in some 2,4-D degrading populations compared to the control.&nbsp; In such altered microbial communities, microbial biomass, and microbial respiration were reduced.&nbsp; Carbon and nitrogen mineralization were also depressed and the depressive effect lasted for a 30 day incubation.&nbsp; Effect of long term high 2,4-D application did not significantly interfere with nutrient transformation although it did reduce plant productivity which may have contributed to the reduction in soil microbial biomass.
    Microcosm studied demonstrated that management history of the soil (40 years plant succession, 10 years no-till, conventional agriculture) did not influence which 2,4-D degraders be3came dominant members in the 2,4-D amended soil.&nbsp; Dominance by Burkholderia sp. was seen in the microcosm studies whilst in the field studies Burkholderia and its close relative Ralstonia sp. were dominant providing evidence of niche partitioning of 2,4-D degrading bacteria in the field.&nbsp; Discontinuing 2,4-D treatment in the southern part of the plots for three years resulted in a decrease in culturable and RSGP detectable population of 2,4-D degrading bacteria although 2,4-d enriched populations were still above control levels three years after 2,4-D added had been suspended.&nbsp; Hence it appears to take many years for perturbed populations to return to their normal densities once the perturbation is removed.

  title: 
  abstract: "The relationship between plant diversity and productivity has received much attention in ecology, but the relationship of these factors to soil microbial communities has been little explored. The carbon resources that support soil microbial communities are primarily derived from plants, so it is likely that the soil microbial community should respond to changes in plant diversity or productivity, particularly if the plant community affects the quality or quantity of available carbon. We investigated the relationship of plant diversity and productivity to the composition of the soil microbial community along a topographic gradient in a mid-successional old-field in southwestern Michigan. Soil moisture, soil inorganic N, and plant biomass increased from the top to the base of the slope, while light at ground level decreased along this same gradient. We characterized the changes in resource levels along this gradient using an index of productivity that incorporated light levels, soil N, soil moisture, and plant biomass. Average plant species richness declined with this productivity index and there were associated compositional changes in the plant community along the gradient. The plant community shifted from predominantly low-growing perennial forbs at low productivities to perennial grasses at higher productivities. Although there was variation in the structure of the soil microbial community [as indicated by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles], changes in the composition of the soil microbial community were not correlated with plant productivity or diversity. However, microbial activity [as indicated by Biolog average well color development and substrate-induced respiration (SIR)] was positively correlated with plant productivity. The similarity between patterns of plant biomass and soil microbial activity suggests that either plant productivity is driving microbial productivity or that limiting resources for each of these two communities co-vary.

    The effect of long term 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
    acid (2,4-D) application on soil nutrient transformation and the
    microbial community structure
  abstract: |-
    2,4-D has been applied to field
    plots for nine years to investigate the effect of 2,4-D on the
    microbial community and how changes in the microbial community
    could effect aspects of the nutrient transformation (C and N
    mineralization). The application rates were, control which is 0
    kg/ha (0x), normal field rate of application 1 kg/ha (1X), 10 kg/ha
    (10X), 100 kg/ha (100X). During the eight and the ninth year, 2,4-D
    was applied every other week for five times from the month August
    and after its application, the microbial community was investigated
    by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) of the
    SSU rDNA genes. The effect of 2,4-D on the microorganisms was
    assessed by determining the microbial biomass, microbial
    respiration and the microbial C:N ratio. Carbon mineralization was
    determined by the static incubation method and similarly for
    Nitrogen mineralization the ammonium and nitrate concentrations
    were determined by KCL extraction.Microbial community fingerprint
    showed the absence of some population profiles in the 100X plots
    which were present in the other treatments. Differences in the peak
    profile occurred around the 400-450 bp region for plots with 100X
    2,4-D application whilst the profiles of the other treatments were
    unaffected. An increase in the qCO2 indicated a possible
    disturbance of high 2,4-D application in the plot where 100X 2,4-D
    had been applied as compared to the control plots. C mineralization
    (Fig.2) and Net N mineralization
    slightly decreased for the 100X plots. Microbial biomass was
    reduced by 22% (Fig. 1) in
    treatments where 100X 2,4-D had been applied as compared to the
    control plots and other treatments. Similarly basal microbial
    respiration was also reduced as 2,4-D concentration increased. The
    rate of nitrification increased as the 2,4-D concentration
    increased indicating that the diamine of the 2,4-D formulation
    might have been a substrate for the nitrifiers. These results
    suggest that applying high 2,4-D rates continually for a period of
    time tends to effect some microbial populations and some ecosystem

  abstract: "Many agroecosystems are unfavorable environments for natural enemies due to high levels of disturbance. Habitat management, a form of conservation biological control, is an ecologically based approach aimed at favoring natural enemies and enhancing biological control in agricultural systems. The goal of habitat management is to create a suitable ecological infrastructure within the agricultural landscape to provide resources such as food for adult natural enemies, alternative prey or hosts, and shelter from adverse conditions. These resources must be integrated into the landscape in a way that is spatially and temporally favorable to natural enemies and practical for producers to implement. The rapidly expanding literature on habitat management is reviewed with attention to practices for favoring predators and parasitoids, implementation of habitat management, and the contributions of modeling and ecological theory to this developing area of conservation biological control. The potential to integrate the goals of habitat management for natural enemies and nature conservation is discussed. "

  abstract: "Characterizing the long-term effect of agricultural management systems on weed communities will aid in developing sustainable weed management practices. Weed seedbanks and aboveground biomass were measured within a corn-soybean-wheat crop sequence from 1990 through 2002 at Hickory Corners, MI. Four management systems were compared: conventional (CONV; full rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage), no till (NT; same as CONV with no primary tillage), reduced input (RI; reduced rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage, mechanical weed control, wheat underseeded with red clover), and organic (ORG; same as RI but no synthetic inputs). Multivariate ordinations of weed seedbanks showed a divergence of the CONV and NT systems from the RI and ORG systems. The CONV and NT seedbanks were dominated by grass species (mainly fall panicum and large crabgrass), whereas the RI and ORG systems were dominated by common lambsquarters and common chickweed. Within a single growing season, weed seedbanks in the RI and ORG systems were positively correlated with weed biomass whereas seedbanks in the CONV and NT system had little predictive value. Weed biomass from 1990 through 2002 showed a strong association of grass weed species with the corn phase of the CONV and NT system and common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed with the corn and soybean phases of the RI and ORG systems. Weed biomass diversity measures were negatively correlated with soybean yields in RI and ORG and wheat yields in NT, RI, and ORG. It is not clear whether crops were less competitive in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments, allowing new weed species to enter the plots, or whether less effective weed management in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments resulted in increased species richness, causing reduced crop yields. Mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between weed community diversity and crop performance."

    An Isotopic
    Method for High Precision, Independent Determination of Dinitrogen
    and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes from Soils
  abstract: |-
    &nbsp;The increasing concentration of nitrous oxide in
    Earth's atmosphere contributes to radiative forcing of climate
    change and to the catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone.
    Understanding the nitrous oxide budget requires understanding the
    relative proportions of nitrous oxide and dinitrogen produced
    during denitrification, which is the major source of nitrous oxide
    in terrestrial environments. Characterization of the
    N2O:N2 flux ratio requires highly precise
    simultaneous flux estimates for both gases. We have developed a
    method that estimates both fluxes independently from the shift in
    isotopic character of gases in confined atmospheres above labeled
    soil. This method has been developed to estimate N2
    flux, which is difficult to measure by other means. We extend the
    method to estimate flux of N2O. Very small fluxes can be
    measured since isotopic analysis of nitrous oxide can be performed
    reliably on less than 0.2 micrograms of N as N2O. Using
    the same method for both N2 and N2O improves
    the reliability of the flux ratio estimate.Results from a field study in April and May of
    1998 illustrate the application of the technique. Incubations were
    conducted before and after natural precipitation, using a soil
    cover over labeled soil. Headspace samples were collected at the
    beginning and end of each incubation. Figure 1 illustrates the
    isotopic character of N2O for each sample; soil N
    enrichment and N2O flux can be infered graphically or
    mathematically. N2 analysis is similar. Figure 2
    summarizes gas fluxes during the period of study. Flux estimates of
    N2O by mass spectrometry agree well with results from
    gas chromatography. Estimates for N2 are near the
    detection limit for this experimental configuration.Figure 1.

We have examined the variability of delta(13)C in soil organic matter in 8 experimental plots prior to the beginning of the 1995-96 FACE experiments with wheat. delta(13)C variability was higher immediately after harvest of a previous crop in June, but the plots were much more homogeneous five months later immediately before planting. Intervening field management, including disking, plowing and installation of irrigation drip tape likely contributed to mixing the soils. "

  abstract: "The uniformity, low cost and ease of application associated with inorganic fertilizers have diminished the use of organic nutrient sources. Concern for food safety, the environment and the need to dispose of animal and municipal wastes have focused attention on organic sources of N such as animal-derived amendments, green manures, and crop rotations. Managing organic N sources to provide sufficient N for crop growth requires knowledge of C and N decomposition over several years, particularly where manure and compost are applied. We report a comparison of compost and chemical fertilizer, use of a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation compared to continuous corn and the use of cover crops. Nitrogen (150d) and C incubations (317 d) were conducted to determine the effect of cropping system and nutrient management on: N mineralization potential (NMP), the mineralizable organic N pool (N.), the mean residence time (MRT) of No, C mineralization (C-min), and soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and fluxes. Compost applications over 6 y increased the resistant pool of C by 30% and the slow pool of C by 10%. The compost treatment contained 14% greater soil organic C than the fertilizer management. Nitrogen was limiting on all compost treatments with the exception of first year corn following wheat fallow and clover cover crop. The clover cover crop and wheat-fallow increased inorganic N in both nutrient managements. We recommend that growers adjust their N fertilizer recommendation to reflect the quantity and timing of N mineralized from organic N sources and the N immobilization that can be associated with compost or other residue applications. Proper management of nutrients from compost, cover crops and rotations can maintain soil fertility and increase C sequestration. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. "

  abstract: "The soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), was detected for the first time in North America in Wisconsin during 2000, and it is currently present in 22 states.  Since its detection, it has developed outbreak populations that resulted in up to 50% yield reduction during alternating years.  I conducted field studies that demonstrated the crucial role of existing generalist natural enemies in suppressing soybean aphid population growth below economic threshold levels.  By using predator exclusion cages, I demonstrated that ambient levels of predators exert strong suppression on soybean aphid (3 to 20-fold reduction) in comparison with open controls and sham cages.  Through work at the NSF-Long Term Ecological Research site at the Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State University, I found that this control occurs over a broad range of agricultural production systems, ranging from conventional practices with or without tillage, to organic soybeans.  This suppression occurs regardless of initial aphid infestation, with aphid populations being reduced below threshold levels at high, medium and low initial aphid densities.  The strength of this suppression results in a trophic cascade, with similar soybean biomass and yield in treatments where aphids were exposed to predation as in treatments completely protected from aphids by aphid exclusion cages. Direct field observations revealed that the coccinellids Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata combined provided most of the mortality on soybean aphid, were very effective on a per capita basis, and responded to aphid density by increasing their abundance, time within the aphid patch, and consumption rate. Exposure to predation significantly shifted the aphid\x92s within-plant distribution towards lower nodes on the plants, suggesting indirect effects of predation. "

    Influence of Soil Treatment on Microbial Community
    Structure as Determined by Quantifying 16S
    rRNA
  abstract: |-
    Most
    knowledge about the importance of microbial activities in soil has
    been obtained through study of microbially-mediated processes, and
    has provided little information on the distribution, relative
    abundance, and diversity of prokaryotic populations in soil.
    Molecular approaches to microbial ecology, such as those utilizing
    ribosomal RNA molecules, enable the study of microbes as they occur
    in soil and are beginning to provide insight on the structure of
    soil microbial communities. The 16S rRNA is an evolutionarily
    constrained molecule, allowing for the design of oligonucleotide
    probes specific for phylogenetically related organisms. In this
    study RNA is being extracted directly from soil and analyzed using
    rRNA specific oligonucleotide probes to determine the contribution
    of population-specific rRNA to total prokaryotic community rRNA.
    The microbial populations being analyzed in this study are the
    Alpha, Beta and Gamma proteobacteria, the High G+C Gram positive
    bacteria, and the cytophaga like bacteria. In addition, the overall
    contribution of Bacterial and Eukaryal rRNA to community rRNA is
    being determined.The
    objective of the proposed research is to characterize the
    distribution and relative activity of the above microbial
    populations in soils associated with varying plant communities and
    agricultural treatment regimes. Currently, three replicate plots
    representing treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have been sampled by
    pooling 5 - 2.5 cm x 10 cm soil cores from each plot. For samples
    taken in October 1996 the observed rRNA abundances have revealed no
    detectable differences in rRNA pool sizes associated with
    populations analyzed in the LTER treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. In
    contrast, the rRNA abundances of the alpha and beta proteobacteria,
    high G+C Gram + bacteria, total Bacteria, and total Eukarya were
    significantly higher in treatment 8 when compared to all other
    treatments (Fig. 1). No
    detectable difference was observed in the rRNA abundance of the
    gamma proteobacteria in treatment 8 relative to other treatments.
    No data is currently available for the cytophaga. The populations
    measured account for approximately 50% of the rRNA present in
    treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 75% of the rRNA in treatment 8. These
    data tend to support the hypothesis that historical land management
    practices can influence microbial community structure for many
    years after a change in land usage. We are currently in the process
    of taking additional samples from the KBS LTER and also from old
    field successional sites to confirm and expand our current
    observations.

  abstract: "1. Carabid beetles are polyphagous predators that can act as biological control agents of insect pests and weeds. While current agricultural practices often create a harsh environment, habitat management such as the establishment of within-field refuges has been proposed to enhance carabid beetle abundance and impact. We examined the joint effects of refuge habitats and insecticide application on carabid activity density(parameter of population density and relative activity) and species composition in a cornfield.  2. Our 2-year study comprised four treatments: (i) -refuge/-insecticide; (ii) +refuge/ -insecticide; (iii) -refuge/+insecticide; (iv) +refuge/+insecticide. Refuge strips consisted of grasses, legumes and perennial flowering plants. '-Refuge' strips were planted with corn and not treated with insecticide. 3. Before planting an insecticide application, carabid activity density in the crop areas was similar across all treatments. Insecticide application immediately reduced carabid activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. 4. Refuge strips had significantly higher activity density of beetles than -refuge strips before planting and during the summer. 5. During summer, as new carabids emerged and insecticide toxicity declined, the presence of refuge strips influenced carabids in the adjacent crop area. Carabid activity density within crop areas previously treated with insecticide was significantly higher when adjacent to refuge strips. Also, carabid communities within insecticide-treated crop areas were affected by the presence or absence of a refuge strip. 6. The presence of refuge strips did not consistently augment carabid numbers in crop areas where insecticide was not applied. One explanation may be that insecticides decreased the quality of crop habitat to carabids by depletion of prey and direct mortality. However, subsequent rebounds in prey density and the absence of competing predators may make these areas relatively more attractive than unperturbed crop habitats to carabid colonization from refuges. 7. This study demonstrates that refuges may buffer the negative consequences of insecticide application on carabids in adjacent fields. Diversifying agro-ecosystems with refuge habitats may be a viable strategy for maintaining carabid populations in disturbed agricultural landscapes to keep pests below outbreak levels. "

  abstract: "A self-transmissible 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degradative plasmid, pKA2, has been identified in a new 2,4-D-degrading strain, Alcaligenes paradoxus 2811P, isolated from agricultural soil. pKA2 occurred as a 42.9-kb plasmid in strain 2811P. A derivative strain, 2811C, was isolated from a stock culture in which the entire pKA2 plasmid was apparently integrated into the host chromosome without loss of the 2,4-D phenotype. This interpretation is based on the disappearance of a free plasmid DNA band, a shift in the tfdA-hybridizing band to the chromosome, loss of transmissibility of the 2,4-D+ trait, and appropriate shifts in Southern hybridization bands of plasmid DNA compared with whole-cell DNA. The integrated plasmid of strain 2811C was excised either precisely or imprecisely after continued transfer on 2,4-D-containing medium. This suggests that a chromosome-free plasmid cycle may occur to optimize fitness under conditions of specific resource fluctuation. Another new 2,4-D-degrading strain, Pseudomonas pickettii 712, which was isolated from the same field plot but at a different time, was found to carry a plasmid that is nearly identical to pKA2. The plasmid of this strain, pKA4, is 40.9 kb long and has features in common with pKA2, such as high self-transmissibility, hybridization only to the tfdA gene among the 2,4-D-metabolic genes of 2,4-D-degradative plasmid pJP4, and similar restriction endonuclease-generated fragments. Furthermore, the genetic homology between the two plasmids was high since all fragments of pKA2 hybridized to pKA4. These results suggest that these two plasmids are closely related and thus their occurrence in two genera in nature is the result of natural horizontal gene transfer. "

    The soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), was detected for the first time in North America in Wisconsin during 2000, and it is currently present in 22 states.  Since its detection, it has developed outbreak populations that resulted in up to 50% yield reduction during alternating years.  I conducted field studies that demonstrated the crucial role of existing generalist natural enemies in suppressing soybean aphid population growth below economic threshold levels.  By using predator exclusion cages, I demonstrated that ambient levels of predators exert strong suppression on soybean aphid (3 to 20-fold reduction) in comparison with open controls and sham cages.  Through work at the NSF-Long Term Ecological Research site at the Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State University, I found that this control occurs over a broad range of agricultural production systems, ranging from conventional practices with or without tillage, to organic soybeans.  This suppression occurs regardless of initial aphid infestation, with aphid populations being reduced below threshold levels at high, medium and low initial aphid densities.  The strength of this suppression results in a trophic cascade, with similar soybean biomass and yield in treatments where aphids were exposed to predation as in treatments completely protected from aphids by aphid exclusion cages. Direct field observations revealed that the coccinellids Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata combined provided most of the mortality on soybean aphid, were very effective on a per capita basis, and responded to aphid density by increasing their abundance, time within the aphid patch, and consumption rate. Exposure to predation significantly shifted the aphid's within-plant distribution towards lower nodes on the plants, suggesting indirect effects of predation.
    
    I also conducted studies using cages that differentially excluded large versus small predators and parasitoids, which showed that ambient levels of naturally occurring parasitoids provide only minor or no reduction of soybean aphid populations, even in treatments in which parasitoids were provided with a refuge from intraguild predation by coccinellids.  Similar results were obtained in a separate study using artificial infestations with the parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes.  I observed direct evidence of intraguild predation on parasitoid mummies by generalist predators, in which up to 80% of mummies were killed by predators, but percentage parasitism did not differ from controls, suggesting that intraguild predation did not disrupt parasitism.  Finally, I developed a mathematical model for soybean aphid population growth by fitting the data of field studies under predator exclusion conditions, using a novel approach that assumes a linear decrease in the intrinsic rate of increase of the aphids.  Overall, these findings provide one of the first empirical tests of recent theoretical models in which the role of generalist predators is predicted to be an important source of insect population regulation.  In addition, these results support theoretical predictions that intraguild predators with strong impacts on herbivores may not disrupt, or may even enhance biological control.  From the pest management perspective, it suggests the incorporation of natural enemies as an important factor to take into account when determining soybean aphid thresholds.

    Nitrous Oxide
    Production from KBS LTER Soils: The Role of Denitrifier
    Diversity
  abstract: |-
    We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial
    diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of
    denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O)
    production. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields
    that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime
    -- a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled
    successional field (KBS LTER treatments 1 and 8, respectively). We
    tested whether denitrifier community composition influences
    denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O
    production [DN2O/(DN2O+N2)], or
    rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the
    effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of
    denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and
    consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in
    non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of
    denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created
    conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences
    in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was
    denitrifier community composition. We found that both
    denitrification rate and rN2O differed for the two soils
    under controlled incubation conditions. These differences suggest
    that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different
    and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the
    same manner. We also found evidence of differential regulation of
    denitrification enzymes among denitrifiers isolated from these same
    two soils. We isolated 93 denitrifying bacteria from treatment 1
    and 63 from treatment 8 soils. Cluster analysis of cellular fatty
    acid profiles of these isolates revealed two levels of taxonomic
    clustering at which the two communities differed. For example, the
    four numerically dominant isolates from each soil were rare or not
    present in the other soil. We measured the sensitivity of
    nos enzyme, which is responsible for the reduction of
    N2O to N2, for representative isolates from
    20 taxa. There was great diversity in the degree of sensitivity to
    oxygen among isolates. Since culturing bacterial isolates under one
    set of conditions tends to select for organisms with similar
    characteristics, this level of physiological diversity probably
    represents a conservative estimate of that which exists in
    situ. This diversity provides a physiological basis for
    community-level differences in nos sensitivity to oxygen
    that could result in ecosystem-level effects of denitrifier
    community composition. Understanding soil N2O flux may
    require a better understanding of the role of denitrifier diversity
    on this important ecosystem function.

The study site consisted of seven treatments arranged in forty-two 0.91-ha plots. Maize, soybean, wheat, alfalfa, Populus, and successional habitats were represented. Habitats were sampled weekly (from late May to the end of August) using yellow sticky traps, sweep net samples, and visual observations. C. septempunctata was detected in all habitats during both years. Habitat preference, however, depended upon availability of prey and habitat disturbance. In 1989, wheat supported C. septempunctata populations early and mid-season, while Populus supported more C. septempunctata later in the season. In 1990, alfalfa was dominant early in the season, soybean in the mid-season, and successional and alfalfa late in the season. The results indicate that both cultivated and uncultivated habitats play an important role in supporting populations of C. septempunctata. "

  title: 
  abstract: Incorporation of crop residues provides a source of readily available C and N, and previous works indicate that farming strategies where crop residues are used for soil fertility purposes may lead to increased emissions of N2O.  Information on the importance of different residue management on the potential for N2O emissions, however, is missing.  The objectives of this work were to determine the short-term effects of crop residue particle siae and spatial distribution on soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O.  Implications for leaching losses of inorganic N were also assessed.  The work included an experiment with lysimeters incubated in the field and an experiment with soil incubated under controlled conditions.  The results show that finely ground pea material (< emm) evolved 50% more N2O (33.8 mg N m-2) than coarse particles (25 mm) of pea material (22.7 mg N m-2) and twice as much N2O as residue-free soil (16.5 mg N m-2).  Barley material, on the other hand, did not influence N2O emissions regardless of particle size (10-17 mg N m-2).  The lack of N2O evolution with barley residue was likely due to N-limitations whereas with N-rich pea material the particle size obviously controlled N-availability.  Carbon dioxide evolution increased about three-fold both with barley and pea residue, but apart from a transient initial depression in CO2 evolution with <3 mm particles there was no overall effect of particle size on CO2 evolution.  Very likely the grinding to <3 mm was inadequate to achieve soil physical protection of the crop residue material against microbial attack.  Leaching of N tended to be reduced about 40% with barley and 20% with pea, but the numbers were not significantly different from residue-free soil, which leached 4.7-4.9 g Nm-2.  When wheat and alfalfa residues were mixed into the soil N2O emissions increased 6.5 and 1.6 times, respectively, compared with residue placed in a layer.  Wheat residue in a layer evolved 3.4-times less N2O than alfalfa in a layer, whereas when mixed the two residue types evolved similar amounts of N2O.  This difference was probably due to N-limitations in localised zones arojund the layered wheat.  The results from this study should be extrapolated to the field situation only after very careful consideration.  Nevertheless, the study emphasizes the potential point of view, incorporating of residues with low N-contents is advantageous over a homogeneous mixing of N-rich materials into the soil.

  title: 
  abstract: The discovery of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matusumura, in North America in 2000 provided the opportunity to investigate the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces in regulating populations of this new invasive herbivore. At the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site in agroecology, we contrasted A. glycines establishment and population growth under three agricultural production systems that differed markedly in disturbance and fertility regimes. Agricultural treatments consisted of a conventional-tillage high-input system, a no-tillage high-input system, and a zero-chemical-input system under conventional tillage. By selectively restricting or allowing predator access we simultaneously determined aphid response to top-down and bottom-up influences. Irrespective of predator exclusion, our agricultural manipulations did not result in bottom-up control of A. glycines intrinsic rate of increase or realized population growth. In contrast, we observed strong evidence for top-down control of A. glycines establishment and overall population growth in all production systems. Abundant predators, including Harmonia axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata, Orius insidiosus, and various predaceous fly larvae, significantly reduced A. glycines establishment and population increase in all trials. In contrast to other systems in which bottom-up forces control herbivore populations, we conclude that A. glycines is primarily controlled via top-down influences of generalist predators under a wide range of agricultural management systems. Understanding the role of top-down and bottom-up forces in this context allows agricultural managers to focus on effective strategies for control of this invasive pest.

    Michigan Field Crop
    Ecology: An Extension Training Manual for Managing Biological
    Processes
  abstract: |-
    As interest in sustainable agriculture increases
    among Extension and agency personnel, training materials are needed
    to help increase understanding of the ecological principles that
    are at the heart of sustainable agriculture. With the assistance of
    these end users, we have developed a training manual that presents
    ecological principles in an agricultural context. Topics include an
    introduction to field crop ecology, an overview of soil ecosystems,
    the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, cover crop ecology, the
    ecology and management of insects (beneficials and pests), and
    nematode ecology and management. Recent research results on the
    benefits of crop rotation and cover crops are highlighted,
    including results from the KBS LTER site. While examples are
    specific to field crops in the Michigan environment, the principles
    discussed are applicable to many agricultural situations. By
    involving farmers and Extension and other agency personnel in the
    development of this publication, we have facilitated greater
    understanding of ecological principles and adoption of sustainable
    agriculture practices. Training sessions using this manual are
    currently being conducted.

We conducted a 3-year, high-resolution N fertilizer response study in southwest Michigan USA to test the hypothesis that N2O fluxes increase mainly in response to N additions that exceed crop N needs. We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0-292 kg N ha(-1)) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N2O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N2O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha(-1), where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to &gt; 50 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)). This threshold N2O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N2O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs.

The TGA quantifies infrared active gases at ambient levels within 2 to 3 min. We tested sensitivity, stability, and calibration of the TGA, and the ability of the NCTGAS to measure fluxes of CO2 and N2O. In addition to static tests, fluxes of CO2 and N2O were simulated by bleeding known quantities of these gases into a test chamber. Gas samples were simultaneously analyzed by TGA and removed for independent analysis of CO2 by conventional infrared gas analysis and for N2O by gas chromatography. The TGA-based flux measurements were statistically identical to the independent measurements of both CO2 and N2O. In situ fluxes of CO2 and N2O measured by the NCTGAS were 105 &plusmn; 6 and 93 &plusmn; 10%, respectively, of those measured from hand-drawn samples. The TGA was as or more stable than conventional means for measuring CO2 and N2O in air at ambient concentrations, and was equally sensitive across the range of concentrations normally encountered in field measurements. Fast response time and ease of use offers significant advantages over conventional gas chromatography. "

    <p>Ecological theory regarding the role of species diversity in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems may have important implications for the design and management of agricultural systems that are less reliant on inputs of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides for fertility and pest control.  However, much of the evidence supporting the importance of diversity in ecosystem function comes from grassland systems where biotic conditions and disturbance regimes differ from those in most managed systems.  Furthermore, agricultural studies that purport to demonstrate the impacts of crop diversity on crop yields and pest regulation are often confounded with applications of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  My research aims to understand how ecological theory regarding the role of diversity in ecosystem function can be used to predict weed and crop yield response to increasing crop diversity.</p>
    
    <p>I examined the relationships between row-crop diversity and ecosystem functions related to weed population regulation and crop productivity in two long-term experimental agroecosystems.  The first system compared corn grown in continuous monoculture and in rotation with soybean and winter wheat under two input management systems: conventional and organic-based.  The second system was an experimental manipulation of crop diversity with no external chemical inputs of fertilizer or herbicides.  Crop diversity was manipulated by growing corn, soybean, and winter wheat continuously and in two and three-crop rotations and with either no, one, or two cover crops annually.</p>
    
    <p>Weed communities and crop yield both varied in response to these treatments. In the first system, weed communities were most variable from year to year in the organic rotation, while corn yield variability was highest in the least diverse cropping system (conventional monoculture).  In the diversity experiment, crop diversity had relatively little effect on the abundance or composition of weeds.  Cover crops in wheat had strong suppressive effects on weeds in both continuous wheat grown in monocultures and in rotation with corn and soybean, while cover crops had little effect on weed abundance or species composition in corn and soybean.</p>
      
    <p>In contrast to the effect on weed communities, crop diversity had large effects on crop productivity.  Corn yields varied across the diversity treatments and in the most diverse treatments were comparable to those in conventionally managed systems in the region.  The positive effect of crop diversity on yields in corn was driven by increased soil N that was related to the number of legume species in the rotation (red clover and soybean).  Soybean yields were also higher in rotations with higher crop diversity, while winter wheat yields were unaffected by the number of crops in the rotation.</p>
    
    <p>These results suggest that increasing crop diversity can have significant impacts on crop yields, particularly in corn, and may decrease the need for intensive chemical management by suppressing weeds during phases of the rotation that are conducive to high cover crop growth (i.e. winter wheat) and by increasing soil nitrogen and the competitive advantage of crops over weeds.</p>

  abstract: "The development of integrated weed management programs requires a clear understanding of the factors and mechanisms conditioning weed community dynamics in agroecosystems. This study evaluated the effect of different agricultural management Systems on the aboveground and seedbank weed communities in annual row crops at the Long Term Ecological Research project in agricultural ecology at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan, USA. Weed biomass and species composition were sampled for six years over two corn-soybean-wheat sequence cycles in four agricultural management systems: (1) conventional (high external chemical input, moldboard plowed); (2) no-till (high external chemical input, no tillage); (3) low-input (low external chemical input, moldboard plowed), and (4) organic (no external chemical input, moldboard plowed), A greenhouse germination study assessed variation in the abundance and composition of the weed seedbank across the studied systems in the first and sixth year of this study.  Aboveground weed biomass, species density, and diversity were lowest in the conventional system, intermediate in the no-till system, and highest in the low-input and organic systems, but there were significant year-by-system interactions. Monocot and dicot species were equally common in the conventional system, whereas annual grasses, such as Digitaria sanguinalis (large crabgrass) and Panicum dichotomiflorum (fall panicum), dominated the no-till system. Two perennial weed species (Trifolium pratense [red clover] and Elytrigia repens [quackgrass]) and one annual dicot (Chenopodium album [common lambsquarters]) dominated the low-input and organic systems. A multivariate ordination of all four systems revealed close associations between the conventional and no-till systems and between the low-input and organic systems. Separate ordinations of the four management systems revealed a crop effect in the low-input and organic systems, but no differentiation in the conventional and no-till ones. The seedbank study revealed a significant increase in the number of weed seeds and species, mainly of annual grasses such as D. sanguinalis and P. dichotomiflorum, in the conventional and no-till systems over the six years of study. During the same period, the number of weed seeds declined in low-input and organic systems. Three annual dicots (Stellaria media [common chickweed], Veronica peregrina [purslane speedwell], and C. album) dominated the seedbank of the low-input and organic systems. Weed aboveground and seedbank community composition were more constant over time in the low-input and organic systems than in the conventional and no-till systems over the study period. These results demonstrate that agricultural management systems can have both immediate and long-term effects on weed species density, abundance, and diversity. The differences observed among management systems in weed biomass, species composition, diversity, and community constancy indicate challenges that exist for the development of ecologically based weed management systems in row crop agriculture.

    Flow of
    Organisms in Agricultural Landscapes
  abstract: |-
    During the first 10 years of the KBS LTER we have
    assessed the response of beneficial insects to landscape structure
    in row crop ecosystems. We selected a group of plant-dwelling
    predators (ladybird beetles) to serve as indicators of biological
    activity in the agricultural landscape. This species complex is
    highly mobile and uses a broad range of habitats during their life
    cycle. The patterns of predator dynamics we have observed in
    response to landscape structure have provide an increased
    understanding of the dynamic role that predatory organisms play as
    chemical substitutes in agricultural landscapes. During the next
    phase of the KBS LTER we will continue our monitoring of ladybird
    beetle species. This is important because changes in plant
    succession and poplar, as well as the maturation of agronomic
    treatments will potentially affect the species composition of
    coccinellids in the landscape. We also need to document the changes
    in species composition in the community of native coccinellids in
    response to the establishment of the exotic species Coccinella
    septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis in Michigan. In
    addition to maintaining this long-term assessment, we will expand
    the scope of our observations to assess patterns of insect activity
    at increased scales. We will increase the number of species of
    predators observed, and expand our observation network to a
    regional scale. In this new phase of the KBS LTER and in
    anticipation of potential changes in weather patterns, we also will
    include in our monitoring efforts selected outbreak-prone herbivore
    species whose population dynamics are very susceptible to weather
    fluctuations. Changes in weather patterns can change the
    competitive balance between plants, herbivores, and predator
    favoring the outbreak of the herbivore populations.

  abstract: "Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents a significant pool of carbon within the biosphere. Climatic shifts in temperature and precipitation have a major influence on the decomposition and amount of SOC stored within an ecosystem. We have linked net primary production algorithms, which include the impact of enhanced atmospheric CO2 on plant growth, to the Soil Organic Carbon Resources And Transformations in EcoSystems (SOCRATES) model to develop a SOC map for the North Central Region of the United States between the years 1850 and 2100 in response to agricultural activity and climate conditions generated by the CSIRO Mk2 Global Circulation Model (GCM) and based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) IS92a emission scenario. We estimate that the current day (1990) stocks of SOC in the top 10 cm of the North Central Region to be 4692 Mt, and 8090 Mt in the top 20 cm of soil. This is 19% lower than the pre-settlement steady state value predicted by the SOCRATES model. By the year 2100, with temperature and precipitation increasing across the North Central Region by an average of 3.9\xB0C and 8.1 cm, respectively, SOCRATES predicts SOC stores of the North Central Region to decline by 11.5 and 2% (in relation to 1990 values) for conventional and conservation tillage scenarios, respectively."

  abstract: "We used two types of laboratory apparatus to test whether rotation-resistant and wild-type Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) responded differently to corn phenology. Beetles from Nebraska where injury to rotated corn has not been reported were defined as wild type, and beetles from Illinois where injury to rotated corn is common represented &quot;rotation-resistant&quot; populations. A two-chamber emigration arena assayed propensity of both populations to leave corn during and after anthesis. A side-arm olfactometer tested whether the relative attraction of beetles to soybean versus corn was influenced by corn phenology. Beetle origin did not influence departure from corn of varying phenology; both emigrated significantly less from young (shedding pollen) than old (no pollen) corn. Significantly more beetles entered olfactometer chambers with soybean than empty control chambers, but there was no difference in response between the two populations. Numbers of beetles entering chambers with soybean varied with the addition of young versus old corn. Replacing young with old corn approximately doubled the percentage of beetles not selecting corn. As corn aged, adult visitation of soybean increased significantly. We suggest this mechanism is sufficient to explain injury to rotated corn, when linked to a corn crop planted early and synchronously within a landscape limited to corn and soybean. This explanation based on preexisting behavioral plasticity should be given due consideration along with conceptual models of D. v. virgifera rotation resistance that imply genetic change. "

  abstract: "Sustainable nitrogen-conservative agroecosystems are increasingly sought by agronomists and environmentalists. This study was designed to evaluate the global hypothesis that temporal continuity of root systems within the soil profile diminishes nitrate leaching and builds easily mineralizable nitrogen pools within root-zone soils. Effects of alfalfa root systems on soil physical properties, soil nitrogen leaching and corn nutrition were investigated in two separate experiments conducted on Kalamazoo loam soils (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) in southwestern Michigan from 1994 to 1996. In the first field experiment, soil nitrogen dynamics were compared under alfalfa and bare fallow. The second field experiment was conducted in conventional and no tillage plots under corn - alfalfa rotation equipped with undisturbed, in situ, large monolith lysimeters. Measurements in this study included: 1) soluble soil mineral nitrogen from suction lysimeters, and fixed soil mineral nitrogen from soil core extractions, 2) volumetric soil water contents by time domain reflectometry, 3) root biomass extracted from deep probe samples, 4) root demographics by minirhizotron technologies, 5) soil physical measurements, and 6) plant biomass and yields. The presence of alfalfa root systems significantly increased saturated hydraulic conductivity, total, and macro-porosities of soils compared to bare fallow. Living alfalfa root systems efficiently prevented nitrate leaching throughout the year, by generally keeping soil solutions below 1 mg L-1  of NO3-N. Second year alfalfa stands accumulated 26 and 76 kg N ha-1  in the crowns and roots respectively. Decomposing alfalfa shoots had little impact on soil nitrate contents compared to root systems, but promoted greater nitrate leaching and denitrification rates. Mineral nitrogen released from spring spray-killed alfalfa and associated soil mineralization was estimated at 115 kg N ha-1  in late November 1996. All nitrogen fertilizer applied to corn, planted directly after spray-killed alfalfa, remained in the soil as mineral nitrogen which was vulnerable to spring leaching. Corn root densities per soil horizon, planted after alfalfa, mimicked alfalfa root demographics. An excess of 40% of the corn roots recolonized alfalfa root induced macropores."

    Variation in Composition and Structure of Soil Microbial
    Communities in Michigan Old Fields
  abstract: |-
    We surveyed soil microbial communities in several
    successional old fields in southwestern Michigan to assess "soil"
    and "plant" effects on community structure. Six replicate early
    successional plots of the same soil fertility and agronomic history
    were compared to four late successional fields of different
    fertility and history. In order to more closely examine soil and
    plant effects on the microbial community, we sampled under the same
    plant species, Andropogon gerardii, as well as under the
    mixed plant community in the four late successional fields.
    Wecharacterized the soil communities with microbial
    biomass C, plate counts, N-mineralization rates, patterns of
    substrate utilization (BIOLOG) and marker fatty acids (PLFA) at
    peak plant biomass (August) and plant senescence (October).
    Preliminary results indicate that microbialcommunities in the early successional plots had
    differing BIOLOG and PLFA patterns than those in the late
    succession fields, possibly due to differences in soil fertility or
    agronomic history. In the four late successional fields, maximum
    potential N mineralization and substrateutilization differed between the communities
    under A. gerardii and those under the mixed plant community.
    These differences may be due to direct effects of plant roots or
    indirect effects of plants on soil moisture or other resources.
    Results from this study suggest that soil history, and possibly
    fertility, may drive differences in microbial communities. The
    difference in microbial functional response to an individual plant
    species, A. gerardii, also indicates that the composition of
    the plant community may be important. Further exploration of
    microbial community structure should include examination of both
    site history and the overlying plant community.

  title: 
  abstract: |-
    Biogeochemical transformations in wetlands impact water quality and nutrient transport across landscapes as well as greenhouse gas fluxes. Anaerobic microbial processes, such as denitrification and methanogenesis, play particularly important roles in the biogeochemical functions of wetlands. I explored the influence of anaerobic microbial processes on wetland biogeochemistry in surficial sediments of southwest Michigan wetlands.
    
    I examined porewater chemistry profiles in sediments of 12 wetlands to see if there was evidence for thermodynamic constraints on anaerobic microbial processes and to see if the wetland's water source impacted the porewater chemistry. Although the large spatial and temporal variability in porewater chemistry obscured patterns among wetlands, wetland porewaters were generally depleted in nitrate and sulfate relative to source waters, and the presence of sulfide in porewaters confirmed that sulfate reduction occurred at most sites. Porewater chemistry showed little relationship to water source.
     
    To further investigate anaerobic microbial decomposition in wetland sediments, I measured ambient rates of denitrification, sulfate reduction, iron reduction, methanogenesis and acetate turnover in three groundwater- and three precipitation-fed wetlands. Denitrification was not detected in any wetland. Iron reduction was measurable mainly in precipitation-fed wetlands, while sulfate reduction rates were greater in groundwater-fed wetlands than in precipitation-fed wetlands. Methanogenesis was measurable in all wetlands, with no differences between wetlands with contrasting water sources, indicating that methanogenesis was important irregardless of water source. Acetate turnover rates were comparable to those measured in other productive sediment environments.
    
    Push-pull experiments provided estimates of potential in-situ rates of denitrification and sulfate reduction. All wetlands examined showed the same potential to rapidly remove nitrate and removal was dependent on concentration. Sulfate was also taken up from injected groundwater in all wetlands, but only after nitrate was depleted. The sulfate reduction rates in groundwater-fed wetlands were independent of sulfate concentrations, while the rates in precipitation-fed wetlands were dependent on sulfate concentrations.
    
    Results from these studies indicate that water source can influence the biogeochemical functions of wetlands, but that other factors could influence anaerobic decomposition as well.

  title: 
  abstract: |-
    As zebra mussels expand their range in North America new ecosystems become invaded. Beginning with the Great Lakes and continuing through the Mississippi River drainage network, the zebra mussel invasion is currently spreading among small inland lakes. Due to the swiftness and magnitude of this invasion and the effects zebra mussels have had on previously invaded ecosystems, it is imperative that the effects of zebra mussels on inland lakes be investigated. In addition, the zebra mussel invasion represents the functional replacement of the multispecies assemblage of native bivalves which typically disappears after invasion. This dissertation examined the ecology of native unionid bivalves (Unionoidae) and exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in order to learn what North American freshwater ecosystems are losing and gaining.
    
    I examined a community of unionids in a stream by using both natural and experimentally enriched stable isotopes of nitrogen as a spin-off project of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX). This is the first and only isotopic enrichment of this taxon. The evidence suggests, contrary to conventional wisdom, that native freshwater mussels they may not be exclusively suspension feeders as adults.
    
    The potential effects of zebra mussels on fish are poorly understood. I examined how larval bluegill growth and survival could be affected by zebra mussels in an experimental mesocosm setting. The hypothesized mechanism of competition between mussels and bluegill for food in the form of microzooplankton was supported. Competition between zebra mussels and obligate planktivores may contribute to ecological harm done to small inland lakes as zebra mussels spread throughout North America. The effects of zebra mussels on microzooplankton reproduction was studied as part of a large mesosoem ZEbra mussel EXperiment (ZMEX), in order to evaluate the relative importance of direct predation on microzooplankton by zebra mussels and indirect competition for resources (phytoplankton as food) causing reduced fecundity.
    
    Another anticipated impact of zebra mussels is the alteration of phytoplankton community structure, including the promotion of the toxic alga Microcystis. I surveyed 60 lakes in the lower peninsula of Michigan to see whether the phytoplankton community has changed in the presence of zebra mussels. Standing stocks of phytoplankton have clearly been reduced in the presence of zebra mussels. While the relative abundance of Microcystis appears to have increased in the presence of zebra mussels there has been little effect on overall phytoplankton community structure.
    
    Nutrient regeneration and benthic-pelagic coupling are important issues concerning zebra mussels. I measured ammonium (NH4), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and the composition of biodeposits in the mesocosm experiment and survey. While increased SRP was detected in the mesocosm experiment, no evidence of increased SRP was found in natural systems. Zebra mussels have, however, evidently reduced the concentrations of DOC in lakes. This is important because DOC attenuates UV-B radiation, and thus invaded systems may be more susceptible

  title: 
  abstract: |-
    Methane oxidation-in aerobic upland soils is an important sink for annually increasing atmospheric methane. The methane oxidation capacity of soil may be declining due to the conversion of natural forest to other uses. I investigate methane oxidation along a gradient of soil disturbance from mature old-growth forest to agricultural fields. I found that soils in the mature deciduous forest oxidize substantially more CH4 than mid-successional forest and no-till agricultural fields.
    
    A single application of 100 kg N fertilizer per hectare significantly decreased CH4 oxidation rates in both mature deciduous forest and mid-successional communities but had no effects in agricultural fields, which already had low oxidation rates. In contrast, a 10 cm depth plowing did not show a significant detectable effect on soil CH4 consumption in any soils. Additionally, lower levels of N fertilization (30 kg N ha-1) significantly affected CH4 oxidation in coniferous forest, but not in deciduous forest nor in mid-successional communities.
    
    Methane oxidation significantly differed among soil depths. In deciduous forest soil cores incubated in the laboratory, CH4 uptake was highest at 5-10 cm depth whereas there were no significant differences with depth (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) in coniferous forest, in a mid-successional community, nor in no-till agricultural soils.
     
    Organic and conventional corn-corn-soybean-wheat management systems also had similar average soil CH4 uptake rates. Nevertheless, CH4 oxidation significantly differed among crops, such that organic corn had the highest rates of oxidation while organic soybean and wheat had the lowest rates. Rates in conventionally managed corn, soybean, and wheat crops were similar and intermediate.
    
    Soil methane oxidation was not significantly correlated with CO2 emission. Soil nitrate and ammonium were weak indicators of changes of CH4 oxidation among land use types and soil depths. Nitrification potential was also a good indicator of CH4 oxidation rates.
    
    Results suggest a major effect of agricultural management on CH4 oxidation in terrestrial ecosystems, with reductions in oxidation capacity related more to changes in nitrogen availability than physical soil disturbance itself. Low-level nitrogen additions (10 kg N ha-1), similar to rates of N-deposition, however, were not sufficient to reduce oxidation in undisturbed forests or mid-successional communities.

  abstract: |-
    The resources that support soil microbial communities are primarily derived from plants, so the soil microbial community should respond to changes in plant diversity or productivity, particularly if changes in the plant community affects the quality or quantity of available resources. I investigated the role of soil and plants on the structure and function of the soil microbial community by conducting observational and experimental studies and two manipulative greenhouse experiments.
    
    I examined the relationship between plant diversity and productivity and soil microbial community structure and function along a topographic gradient in a successional old-field in Michigan. Variation in plant productivity was confounded by changes in plant community diversity and edaphic characteristics, so I could not determine which of these variables caused the observed changes in the soil microbial community. 
    
    To further investigate the relationship between the soil microbial community and plant species diversity, I sampled soils from a set of experimental grassland plant communities established as part of the BIODEPTH experiment at Silwood Park, England. Plant species diversity, functional group diversity, and species composition varied across treatments. I found that plant diversity significantly affected soil microbial community structure. However, N-mineralization rates and microbial respiration responded to variation in plant community composition, but not diversity. 
    
    In a greenhouse experiment I examined how variation in soil fertility influenced the soil microbial community. I found that soil origin had strong effects on the structure and function of the soil microbial community. Higher fertility soils had higher organic nitrogen pools and microbial activities and more eukaryotes in the microbial community. In addition, the presence of Andropogon gerardi also affected the structure and function of the soil microbial community. However, the magnitude of the plant effect on soil microbial respiration was inversely related to soil fertility. 
    
    In a second greenhouse experiment I further explored the plant species effect on the soil microbial community. I found strong effects of both plant species identity and soil origin on the structure and function of the soil microbial community. In particular, the presence of a legume (Trifolium pratense) increased soil nitrogen cycling processes. Plant species identity had a small effect on soil microbial community structure, but it was dwarfed by the soil origin effect.
    
    Results from these studies indicate that several aspects of the plant community, including diversity, composition and individual plant species identities, can strongly influence the structure and function of the soil microbial community. However, other environmental factors that affect soil quality can have strong and persistent effects on the soil microbial community.

  abstract: "We studied the relationship between amounts of fungi and ergosterol in soil to further evaluate the use of ergosterol as an indicator of soil fungal biomass. Soils from seven sites in central Iowa were analyzed for soil ergosterol content, total fungal hyphal length (living and non-living, using calcofluor as stain), and living fungal hyphal length (using fluorescein diacetate as stain) to: 1) determine how soil ergosterol concentration correlates with total fungal hyphal length and living fungal hyphal length; and 2) determine an approximate value for ergosterol concentration in living fungal biomass present in soil. Correlation significance tests and analysis of variance indicated highly significant positive correlation between soil ergosterol content and both measures of hyphal length, but regression analysis demonstrated only a moderate degree of linear correlation between these variables (coefficients of linear correlation, r = 0.638 to 0.874). Calculated values for ergosterol concentration in living fungal biomass present in the soils examined ranged from 5 to 31 mg ergosterol g(-1) living fungal biomass. Data indicate that the wide range in specific ergosterol content of living fungal biomass in soils is related to the total amount of fungal hyphae (living and non-living) in a soil. We propose a method to estimate living fungal biomass from soil ergosterol content which compensates for the variability in fungal ergosterol concentrations by accounting for this relationship. A preliminary evaluation of this approach using independent data from the literature provides support for this method, in that a high correlation (r(2) = 0.999) between predicted and measured living fungal biomass was observed.

  abstract: The Kalamazoo River (Michigan, USA) has six run-of-the-river dams. The two hydropower reservoirs' residence times vary from 2 up to 11 days during the year. The four decommissioned impoundments residence times vary from a quarter of day to 1.5 days during the year. Inflows and outflows for the two hydropower reservoirs were sampled weekly in order to quantify the roles of reservoirs as sinks or transformers for nutrients. Three longitudinal river surveys from Morrow Lake inflow to Lake Allegan outflow were conducted at varying discharges. Special emphasis was placed on above and below Plainwell, Otsego, Allegan City and Trowbridge decommissioned impoundments. Despite their spatial proximity, a Total Maximum Daily Load for phosphorus (P) was deemed necessary for Lake Allegan to control summer algal blooms, whereas Morrow Lake lacks nuisance summer algal blooms. Lake Allegan outflow waters exhibited potential silica and nitrogen limitation in the late summer while Morrow Lake did not, which may explain the undesirable algal blooms in Lake Allegan. The longer residence time allows phytoplankton to build up to undesirable levels within Lake Allegan, but not in Morrow Lake. High algal abundance was observed in the Lake Allegan inflow, which may have resulted from Morrow Lake's algae transported downstream, or new algal biomass build-up as the river passed through semi-impounded reaches; the results reported here support the latter hypothesis.

  title: 
  abstract: This study evaluates whether previous observations of a higher percentage of parasitism and parasitoid diversity in a complex agricultural landscape, relative to a simple landscape, represent a general phenomenon. Rates of parasitism and parasitoid diversity of the armyworm (Pseudaletia unipuncta) were assessed in three replicate (Onondaga, Ingham, and Benton) regions in southern Michigan. Within each region, a simple landscape (primarily cropland) and a complex landscape (cropland intermixed with mid and late successional noncrop habitats) were identified through analysis of aerial photographs. In each landscape, three maize fields were selected, and second to fourth instar P. unipuncta were released into three replicate plots of maize plants. Larvae were recovered after 6 d and reared in the laboratory to record parasitoid emergence. A principal component analysis conducted on landscape variables indicated that simple and complex landscapes were true replicates. Extra-field vegetation was similar among the three simple landscapes but differed among complex sites. Parasitoid species diversity differed among regions, with six species recovered in Onondaga and two species from both Benton and Ingham. Rates of parasitism were only partially consistent with previous experimental results. In Ingham, results were similar to those found previously in this region; rates of parasitism and parasitoid diversity were higher in the complex landscape. However, in Onondaga and Benton, no difference in rates of parasitism or parasitoid diversity were found. Thus, the hypothesis that landscape complexity increases parasitoid diversity and rates of parasitism was not supported. Possible reasons for the observed differences in rates of parasitism among regions are discussed

  abstract: "An integrative approach was used to obtain pure cultures of previously uncultivated members of the divisions Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia from agricultural soil and from the guts of wood-feeding termites. Some elements of the cultivation procedure included the following: the use of agar media with little or no added nutrients; relatively long periods of incubation (more than 30 days); protection of cells from exogenous peroxides; and inclusion of humic acids or a humic acid analogue (anthraquinone disulfonate) and quorum-signaling compounds (acyl homoserine lactones) in growth media. The bacteria were incubated in the presence of air and in hypoxic (1 to 2% O-2 [vol/vol]) and anoxic atmospheres. Some bacteria were incubated with elevated concentrations of CO2 (5% [vol/vol]). Significantly more Acidobacteria were found on isolation plates that had been incubated with 5% CO2. A simple, high-throughput, PCR-based surveillance method (plate wash PCR) was developed. This method greatly facilitated detection and ultimate isolation of target bacteria from as many as 1,000 colonies of nontarget microbes growing on the same agar plates. Results illustrate the power of integrating culture methods with molecular techniques to isolate bacteria from phylogenetic groups under-represented in culture. "

  abstract: "Forty-seven numerically dominant 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading bacteria were isolated at different times from 1989 through 1992 from eight agricultural plots (3.6 by 9.1 m) which were either not treated with 2,4-D or treated with 2,4-D at three different concentrations. Isolates were obtained from the most dilute positive most-probable-number tubes inoculated with soil samples from the different plots on seven sampling dates over the 3-year period. The isolates were compared by using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles, chromosomal patterns obtained by PCR amplification of repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences, and hybridization patterns obtained with probes for the tfd genes of plasmid pJP4 and a probe (Spa probe) that detects a distinctly different 2,4-D-degrading isolate, Sphingomonas paucimobilis (formerly Pseudomonas paucimobilis). A total of 57% of the isolates were identified to the species level by the FAME analysis, and these isolates were strains of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, or Alcaligenes species. Hybridization analysis revealed four groups. Group I strains, which exhibited sequence homology with tfdA, -B, -C, and -D genes, were rather diverse, as determined by both the FAME analysis and the REP-PCR analysis. Group II, which exhibited homology only with the tfdA gene, was a small group and was probably a subset of group I. All group I and II strains had plasmids. Hybridization analysis revealed that the tfd genes were located on plasmids in 75% of these strains and on the chromosome or a large plasmid in the other 25% of the strains. One strain exhibited tfdA and -B hybridization associated with a plasmid band, while tfdC and -D hybridized with the chromosomal band area. The group III strains exhibited no detectable homology to tfd genes but hybridized to the Spa probe. The members of this group were tightly clustered as determined by both the FAME analysis and the REP-PCR analysis, were distinctly different from group I strains as determined by the FAME analysis, and had very few plasmids; this group contained more of the 47 isolates than any other group. The group III strains were identified as S. paucimobilis. The group IV strains, which hybridized to neither the tfd probe nor the Spa probe, were as diverse as the group I strains as determined by the FAME and REP-PCR analyses. Most of group IV strains could not be identified by the FAME analysis. Strains belonging to groups I and III were more frequently recovered from soils that had greater field exposure to 2,4-D, suggesting that they were the best competitors for 2,4-D under field conditions. The selection regimen which we used led to two successful but dissimilar groups; the members of one group were similar at the plasmid level but not at the organism level, and the members of the other group were similar at the organism level. Since the members of the latter group are ecologically successful and have degradative genes unlike tfd genes, they deserve more attention. "

  abstract: "Geostatistical techniques were used to quantify the scale and degree of soil heterogeneity in 2 m(2) plots around 9-year-old poplar trees and within a wheat field. Samples were taken during two years, on an unaligned grid, for analysis of soil respiration, C and N content, available P, gravimetric moisture, pH, nitrification potential, and root biomass. Kriged maps of soil respiration, moisture, and C content showed strong spatial structure associated with poplar trees but not with wheat rows. All soil properties showed higher autocorrelation in June than in April. Isopleth patchiness for all variates was less in June. This was associated with lower respiration rates due to lower litter decomposition. From the degree and scale of heterogeneity seen in this study, we conclude that the main causes of soil heterogeneity at this scale (2 m(2)) are likely to be found at micro scales controlled in part by plant root and plant residue patterns. These must be understood in the evaluation of ecosystem processes. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Denitrification in soil is the major source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N20), a potent contributor to global warming and a regulator of stratospheric ozone. Flux of N20 to the atmosphere is poorly understood. There is a serious imbalance in the global N20 budget (missing sources), and N20 flux at the field scale is difficult to predict, even when the rate of denitrification has been adequately characterized. In this dissertation, I review the literature pertaining to the relationship between denitrification and N20 flux, emphasizing a major source of uncertainty: relative production of N20 and N2 (dinitrogen) during denitrification. I explore the ecological factors that influence the nitrous oxide mole fraction ( N20 / [ N20 + N2 ] ), an aspect of denitrification that expresses relative production of N20 and N2. Second, I develop theory that facilitates the evaluation of N20 and N2 flux using 15N-labeled compounds and mass spectrometry. My heuristic model of labeled N-gas flux from soil simplifies the process of drawing inferences from isotope data. Third, I report new procedures for measuring fluxes of labeled N20 and N2 for the same incubation using mass spectrometry. My procedures could lead to improved estimates of the nitrous oxide mole fraction. I illustrate these procedures with field data. Finally, I describe a laboratory experiment in which I combine traditional and isotope methods to test for effects of moisture history (antecedent soil moisture) and ecosystem management history on nitrous oxide mole fraction, while controlling soil type and moisture. I find that response of mole fraction to differences in short-term (48 h) soil moisture history is different for soils from ecosystems with different management histories. A cropped soil had a high (-0.9) mole fraction after rapid transition from air-dry to 85% water-filled pore space but a low (-0.3) mole fraction when 80% of added moisture was applied 48 h in advance of the incubation. However, soil from a successional system generated a nitrous oxide mole fraction of about 0.3 regardless of short term moisture history. Progress in understanding the relationship between denitrification and nitrous oxide flux from soil seems still to be methods-limited."

  abstract: "The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was applied to soils in microcosms, and degradation was monitored after each of five repeated additions. Total DNAs were isolated from soil bacterial communities after each 2,4-D treatment. The DNA samples were analyzed on slot blots and Southern blots by using a tfdA gene probe subcloned from plasmid pJP4 and a Spa probe derived from a different 2,4-D-degrading isolate, a Sphingomonas paucimobilis strain. 2,4-D applied to soil was quickly degraded by indigenous microbial populations. As determined by slot blot analyses of DNA from a Michigan soil, the increase in hybridization signal in response to 2,4-D treatments was greater with the Spa probe than with the tfdA probe. In contrast, the DNA from a Saskatchewan soil exhibited an increase in hybridization signal with the tfdA probe. This indicated that a population with 2,4-D-degradative gene sequence; different from the tfdA gene sequence was dominant in the Michigan site, but not in the Saskatchewan site. A Southern blot analysis of DNA from Michigan soil showed that the dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was S. paucimobilis 1443. A less dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was detected with the tfdA probe; further analysis revealed that this population was a Pseudomonas pickettii 712. These gene probe analyses revealed that an important population carrying out 2,4-D degradation was not detected when the canonical tfdA gene probe was used. After a series of new strains were isolated, we identified a probe to detect and identify the dominant members of this new group. "

  abstract: "The effect of standard agricultural management on the genetic heterogeneity of nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) fragments from denitrifying prokaryotes in native and cultivated soil was explored. Thirty-six soil cores were composited from each of the two soil management conditions. nosZ gene fragments were amplified from triplicate samples, and PCR products were cloned and screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RELP). The total nosZ RFLP profiles increased in similarity with soil sample size until triplicate 3-g samples produced visually identical RFLP profiles for each treatment. Large differences in total nosZ profiles were observed between the native and cultivated soils. The fragments representing major groups of clones encountered at least twice and four randomly selected clones with unique RFLP patterns were sequenced to verify nosZ identity. The sequence diversity of nosZ clones from the cultivated field was higher, and only eight patterns were found in clone libraries from both soils among the 182 distinct nosZ RFLP patterns identified from the two soils. A group of clones that comprised 32% of all clones dominated the gene library of native soil, whereas many minor groups were observed in the gene library of cultivated soil. The 95% confidence intervals of the Chao1 nonparametric richness estimator for nosZ RFLP data did not overlap, indicating that the levels of species richness are significantly different in the two soils, the cultivated soil having higher diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences grouped the majority of nosZ clones into an interleaved Michigan soil cluster whose cultured members are alpha-Proteobacteria. Only four nosZ sequences from cultivated soil and one from the native soil were related to sequences found in gamma-Proteobacteria. Sequences from the native field formed a distinct, closely related cluster (D-mean = 0.16) containing 91.6% of the native clones. Clones from the cultivated field were more distantly related to each other (D-mean = 0.26), and 65% were found outside of the cluster from the native soil, further indicating a difference in the two communities. Overall, there appears to be a relationship between use and richness, diversity, and the phylogenetic position of nosZ sequences, indicating that agricultural use of soil caused a shift to a more diverse denitrifying community.

  title: 
  abstract: Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is anticipated to increase over the next decades with possible implications for future forest-atmosphere interactions. Increased soil N2O emissions, depressed CH4 uptake and depressed soil respiration CO2 loss is considered a likely response to increased N deposition. This study examined fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 over two growing seasons from soils in unmanaged forest and grassland communities on abandoned agricultural areas in Michigan. All sites were subject to simulated increased N-deposition in the range of 1&ndash;3 g N m&minus;2 annually. Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil N concentrations in coniferous and grassland sites were on the whole unaffected by the increased N-inputs. It is noteworthy though that N2O emissions increased three-fold in the coniferous sites in the first growing season in response to the low N treatment, although the response was barely significant (p&lt;0.06). In deciduous forests, we observed increased levels of soil mineral N during the second year of N fertilization, however N2O fluxes did not increase. Rates of methane oxidation were similar in all sites with no affect of field N application. Likewise, we did not observe any changes in soil CO2 efflux in response to N additions. The combination of tillage history and vegetation type was important for the trace gas fluxes, i.e. soil CO2 efflux was greater in successional grassland sites compared with the forested sites and CH4 uptake was reduced in post-tillage coniferous- and successional sites compared with the old-growth deciduous site. Our results indicate that short-term increased N availability influenced individual processes linked to trace gas turnover in the soil independently from the ecosystem N status. However, changes in whole system fluxes were not evident and were very likely mediated by competitive N uptake processes.

  abstract: "Competition among indigenous and inoculated 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading bacteria was studied in a native Kansas prairie soil following 2,4-D additions. The soil was inoculated with four different 2,5-D-degrading strains at densities of 10(3) cells per g of soil; the organisms used were Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1(pJP4) and three Michigan soil isolates, strain 745, Sphingomonas paucimobilis 1443, and Pseudomonas pickettii 712. Following 2,4-D additions, total soil DNA was extracted and analyzed on Southern blots by using a tfdA gene probe which detected three of the strains and another probe that detected the fourth strain, S. paucimobilis 1443, which belongs to a different class of 2,4-D degraders. P. cepacia DBO1 (pJP4), a constructed strain, outcompeted the other added strains and the indigenous 2,4-D-degrading populations. The S. paucimobilis population was the secondary dominant population, and strain 745 and P. pickettii were not detected. Relative fitness coefficients determined in axenic broth cultures predicted the outcome of competition in soil for some but not all strains. Lag time was shown to be a principal determinant of competitiveness among the strains, but the lag times were significantly reduced in mixed broth cultures, which changed the competitive outcome. Plasmids containing the genes for the 2,4-D pathway were important determinants of competitiveness since plasmid pKA4 in P. cepacia DBO1 resulted in the slower growth characteristic of its original host, P. pickettii, rather than the rapid growth observed when this strain harbors pJP4.

  title: 
  abstract: "There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.

Carabid beetles were sampled with pitfall traps and invertebrate seed predation rates of fall panicum and common lambsquarters were assayed with exclosure cages. Total carabid activity-density was over two times higher in the conventional systems compared to the no-till and organic management systems. In contrast, activity-densities of seed-predating carabid species were over three times higher in the no-till compared to the conventional and organic systems. Carabid diversity was higher in the no-till and organic systems compared to the conventional system, and a multivariate analysis showed that carabid community structure was distinct among the three systems. Predation of fall panicum and common lambsquarters seeds was often over two times higher in the no-till compared to the conventional and organic systems, and there was a strong correlation (r > 0.94) between seed removal rates and the total number of carabid seed predators captured in each system.

  abstract: "The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)-degrading microbial populations selected by 2,4-D amendments to soil were analyzed by DNA probes during a 4-yr held study. Two were control subplots not treated with 2,4-D, and the other six were treated with 2,4-D in replicates at three different concentrations. Total soil bacterial DNA was regularly extracted from each subplot soil and analyzed on slot and Southern blots using the gene probes tfdA and Spa that detect two different 2,4-D-degrading populations. Slot blot analyses revealed that the hybridization signal of the probes to total soil bacterial DNA substantially increased with time and continued 2,4-D application, indicating a shift from a more diverse 2,4-D-degrading microflora to populations that shared greater homology to the two probes. More hybridization signal was obtained with the Spa probe, suggesting that microorganisms with this gene sequence were more dominant than degraders with tfdA-like genes. The Southern blot band patterns indicated that the dominant Spa-hybridizing strain was Sphingomonas paucimobilis strain 1443 and the dominant tfdA hybridizing strain was Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) pickettii strain 712, similar to the results of a previous laboratory microcosm study. At the highest 2,4-D application rate (100 mg kg(-1)), Southern blots probed by 16S rRNA genes showed a limited number of bands, suggesting that the total soil microbial community had been shifted to one or two dominant strains, presumably 2,4-D degraders.

  title: 
  abstract: "Measuring the tempospatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is time consuming, expensive, and encounters many uncertainties. This work aimed to develop a new model (REPM, Relative Effective Porosity Model) that estimates Ks from relative effective porosity (phi (er)) and then compare it with a model (EPM, Effective Porosity Model) that estimates it from effective porosity (phi (e)). The effective porosity (phi (e)) is defined as the total porosity minus field capacity (FC), and the relative effective porosity (phi (er)) is defined as effective porosity (phi (e)) divided by FC. Both phi (er) and phi (e) can be estimated from FC and bulk density (B-d). Data from 11 homogeneous textural-class mean soils and several international and American soils were used to evaluate REPM and EPM. For the 11 textural-class mean soils, log (K-s) was highly correlated to log (phi (er)) as well as to log (phi (e)). For the international soils, log (K-s) was highly correlated to log (r(2) = 0.77), but the correlation was less pronounced between log (K-s) and log (phi (e)) (r(2) = 0.58). The saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils from an international database was more accurately predicted by REPM (RMSE of 539 cm d(-1)) than by EPM (RMSE of 733 cm d(-1)), while both of them performed as well for American soils. The slope and the intercept of REPM and the slope of EPM were independent of soil. These results suggest that our new model gives reasonable estimates of K-s for different soils. "

  abstract: We analyzed the communities of soil basidiomycetes in agroecosystems that differ in tillage history at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research site near Battle Creek, Michigan. The approach combined soil DNA extraction through a bead-beating method modified to increase recovery of fungal DNA, PCR amplification with basidiomycete-specific primers, cloning and restriction fragment length polymorphism screening of mixed PCR products, and sequencing of unique clones. Much greater diversity was detected than was anticipated in this habitat on the basis of culture-based methods or surveys of fruiting bodies. With "species" defined as organisms yielding PCR products with 99% identity in the 5' 650 bases of the nuclear large-subunit ribosomal DNA, 241 "species" were detected among 409 unique basidiomycete sequences recovered. Almost all major clades of basidiomycetes from basidiomycetous yeasts and other heterobasidiomycetes through polypores and euagarics (gilled mushrooms and relatives) were represented, with a majority from the latter clade. Only 24 of 241 "species" had 99% or greater sequence similarity to named reference sequences in GenBank, and several clades with multiple "species" could not be identified at the genus level by phylogenetic comparisons with named sequences. The total estimated "species" richness for this 11.2-ha site was 367 "species" of basidiomycetes. Since >99% of the study area has not been sampled, the accuracy of our diversity estimate is uncertain. Replication in time and space is required to detect additional diversity and the underlying community structure.

  abstract: "A study was conducted to assess the potential of combined imagery from the existing European and Japanese orbital synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, ERS-1 (C-band, VV-polarization) and JERS-1 (L-band, HH-polarization), for regional-to-global-scale vegetation classification. For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites mere generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2-D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization. "

  abstract: "Methane oxidation in well-aerated soils is a significant global sink for atmospheric methane. We examined the effects of soil disturbance (simulated tillage) and N-fertilizer additions on methane oxidation in old-growth forest, mid-successional, and no-till maize ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. We found highest oxidation rates in forest sites (about 30 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) on average), with average rates in successional and agricultural sites about 75 and 12% of this, respectively. In the forest and successional sites a one-time N-fertilizer addition (100 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1)) significantly suppressed oxidation for the several weeks that inorganic N pools were elevated. There was no effect of fertilizer addition in the agricultural site, where available N was already high and oxidation rates low. Soil disturbance by itself had no detectable effect on fluxes in any of the sites. Results confirm the overriding importance of elevated N for suppressing CH4 oxidation in managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and suggest further that recovery of CH4 suppression following agriculture is related to slow-changing soil properties such as soil organic matter composition or microbial community structure.

  abstract: "Although natural selection appears to favor the elimination of gene redundancy in prokaryotes, multiple copies of each rRNA-encoding gene are common on bacterial chromosomes. Despite this conspicuous deviation from single-copy genes, no phenotype has been consistently associated with rRNA gene copy number. We found that the number of rRNA genes correlates with the rate at which phylogenetically diverse bacteria respond to resource availability, Soil bacteria that formed colonies rapidly upon exposure to a nutritionally complex medium contained an average of 5.5 copies of the small subunit rRNA gene, whereas bacteria that responded slowly contained an average of 1.4 copies. In soil microcosms pulsed with the herbicide 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D), indigenous populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria with multiple rRNA genes ((x) over bar = 5.4) became dominant, whereas populations with fewer rRNA genes ((x) over bar = 2.7) were favored in unamended controls. These findings demonstrate phenotypic effects associated with rRNA gene copy number that are indicative of ecological strategies influencing the structure of natural microbial communities. "

The greatest interannual variability in ANPP occurred in grasslands and old fields, with forests the Least variable, At a continental scale, ANPP was strongly correlated with annual precipitation. However, interannual variability in ANPP was not related to variability in precipitation. Instead, maximum variability in ANPP occurred in biomes where high potential growth rates of herbaceous vegetation were combined with moderate variability in precipitation. In the most dynamic biomes, ANPP responded more strongly to wet than to dry years. Recognition of the fourfold range in ANPP dynamics across biomes and of the factors that constrain this variability is critical for detecting the biotic impacts of global change phenomena. "

    1. We studied whole-ecosystem metabolism in eight streams from several biomes in North America to identify controls on the rate of stream metabolism over a large geographic range. The streams studied had climates ranging from tropical to cool-temperate and from humid to arid and were all relatively uninfluenced by human disturbances.
    
    2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open-system, two-station diurnal oxygen change method.
    
    3. Three general patterns in metabolism were evident among streams: (1) relatively high GPP with positive NEP (i.e. net oxygen production) in early afternoon, (2) moderate primary production with a distinct peak in GPP during daylight but negative NEP at all times and (3) little or no evidence of GPP during daylight and a relatively constant and negative NEP over the entire day.
    
    4. Gross primary production was most strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A multiple regression model that included log PAR and stream water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration explained 90% of the variation in log GPP.
    
    5. Ecosystem respiration was significantly correlated with SRP concentration and size of the transient storage zone and, together, these factors explained 73% of the variation in R. The rate of R was poorly correlated with the rate of GPP.
    
    6. Net ecosystem production was significantly correlated only with PAR, with 53% of the variation in log NEP explained by log PAR. Only Sycamore Creek, a desert stream in Arizona, had positive NEP (GPP: R > 1), supporting the idea that streams are generally net sinks rather than net sources of organic matter.
    
    7. Our results suggest that light, phosphorus concentration and channel hydraulics are important controls on the rate of ecosystem metabolism in streams over very extensive geographic areas

The factorial experiment included two levels of defoliation (defoliated and control) and fertilization (100 kg N.ha(-1) and control). Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) populations were manipulated to obtain defoliation in the summer of 1996, 1997, and 1998; fertilization subplots were fertilized with NH4NO3 (100 kg N.ha(-1)) in the spring of these years. There were no significant effects of defoliation on ECM or AM colonization in either year; there was a significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) decline in AM colonization in fertilized plots in 1997 and a significant interaction between defoliation and fertilization effects on ECM colonization in 1997. In the nondefoliated plots, ECM fungal colonization increased, whereas AM colonization decreased because of fertilization. In the defoliated plots, neither ECM nor AM colonization was affected by fertilization. ECM community composition and richness were unchanged by any treatment. The small and transient effects of defoliation and fertilization on poplar AMs and ECMs demonstrate the tolerance of these early-successional trees to defoliation and their ability to rapidly use high levels of available nitrogen.

  title: 
  abstract: "Nutrient uptake length is an important parameter for quantifying nutrient cycling in streams. Although nutrient tracer additions are the preferred method for measuring uptake length under ambient nutrient concentrations, short-term nutrient addition experiments have more frequently been used to estimate uptake length in streams. Theoretical analysis of the relationship between uptake length determined by nutrient addition experiments (S w ? ) and uptake length determined by tracer additions (S w ) predicted that S w ? should be consistently longer than S w and that the overestimate of uptake length by S w ? should be related to the level of nutrient addition above ambient concentrations and the degree of nutrient limitation. To test these predictions, we used data from an interbiome study of NH 4 + uptake length in which 15 NH 4 + tracer and short-term eNH 4 + addition experiments were performed in 10 streams using a uniform experimental approach. The experimental results largely confirmed the theoretical predictions: S w ? was consistently longer than S w and S w ? \\colonS w ratios were directly related to the level of NH 4 + addition and to indicators of N limitation. The experimentally derived S w ? \\colonS w ratios were used with the theoretical results to infer the N limitation status of each stream. Together, the theoretical and experimental results showed that tracer experiments should be used whenever possible to determine nutrient uptake length in streams. Nutrient addition experiments may be useful for comparing uptake lengths between different streams or different times in the same stream, however, provided that nutrient additions are kept as low as possible and of similar magnitude"

  abstract: "Accurate determination of leaf appearance rate is required in crop simulation models to estimate canopy development and ultimately crop yield. Most crop simulation models use air temperature for thermal time calculations to estimate leaf appearance rate, although the near soil temperature is more closely related to the growing apex temperature than air temperature before stem elongation. A held experiment was conducted in 1996 at East Lansing, MI, to determine the effect of soil, air, and apex temperatures on maize (Zea mays L.) leaf development. Maize leaf tip appearance dates and leaf numbers were observed on four sowing dates to provide variations in the thermal regime of developing plants. Solar irradiance and temperature of the air (1.5 m height), apex, and soil (1-, 3-, and 5-cm depths) were recorded on 0.5-h (half-hourly) intervals. The daily average soil temperature at the 3- to 5-cm depth was reasonably close (+0.6 degreesC in average) to the daily average apex temperature for use as a surrogate for apex temperature to increase the accuracy of maize development simulation in the sowing to ninth leaf tip stage. Thereafter, the air temperature was sufficiently accurate to estimate plant development. Using apex temperatures from leaf 3 to 9, this study indicated that the phyllochron was near 55 degreesC d (degree days) per leaf tip appearance. The consistent bias between air and apex temperature from sowing to V6 found in this study clearly indicates the necessity of using the right temperature in thermal time calculations for accurate maize development simulation.

  abstract: "Early colonizing annual plants are rapidly suppressed in secondary succession on fertile midwestern old fields, while later colonizing perennials persist. Differences in competitive ability for above- and belowground resources may be partly responsible for differences in species persistence during succession, as both light and nutrient availability may change rapidly. We found that, although both above- and belowground competition suppress growth of colonizing plants, belowground competition was the dominant factor in the suppression of the annual Ambrosin artemisiifolia in 2nd-year-old fields near the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan. Despite an ability to persist in later successional fields, seedling transplants of the perennial Achillea millefolium were also suppressed by above- and belowground competition, with belowground competition having the strongest effect. As in many old fields, nitrogen availability is the primary factor limiting plant productivity. There was no clear difference between the species in ability to compete for N-15 from an enriched patch, although there was an indication of greater precision of foraging by Achillea. Life history differences between these species and consequent differences in the phenology of root growth relative to other old-field plants are likely to play a large role in the persistence of Achillea in successional fields where Ambrosia is suppressed.

  abstract: "The Maricopa cotton and wheat FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments offer propitious opportunity to quantify carbon turnover. The commercial CO2 (delta(13)C approximate to-37 parts per thousand) used to elevate CO2 concentration in field plots provided a strongly C-12-depleted tracer. Soil CO2 and delta(13)C of soil organic carbon (SOC) in CO2-enriched and Control plots were measured between the final cotton FACE project (October 1991) and the end of the second wheat experiment (June 1994). The initial C-13-depletion in SOC of cotton FACE plots (measured by the difference in delta(13)C between FACE and Control plots) persisted at the same level (1.9 parts per thousand) 1.5 years after the experiment ended. A similar depletion was observed in soil CO2 evolved in the same plots, indicating ongoing decomposition of the new SOC. The SOC delta(13)C of wheat plots before and after two growing seasons showed increasing C-13-depletion in FACE relative to Control. Isotopic mass balance was consistent with 5-6% new carbon input from the two wheat crops. This is lower than the 12-13% calculated for FACE cotton and perhaps a consequence of the larger root system of cotton or the 3-year duration of the cotton experiments versus 2 years for the wheat. "

  abstract: Field biologists and ecologists are starting to open new avenues of inquiry at greater spatial and temporal resolution, allowing them to &quot;observe the unobservable&quot; through the use of wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks facilitate the collection of diverse types of data (from temperature to imagery and sound) at frequcnt intervals - even multiple times per second - over large areas, allowing ecologists and field biologists to engage in intensive and expansive sampling and to unobtrusively collect new types of data. Moreover, real-time data flows allow researchers to react rapidly to events, thus extending the laboratory to the field. We review some existing uses of wireless sensor networks, identify possible areas of application, and review the underlying technologies in the hope of stimulating additional use of this promising technology to address the grand challenges of environmental science.

  abstract: "Carbon (C) can be sequestered in the mineral soil after the conversion of intensively cropped agricultural fields to more extensive land uses such as afforested and natural succession ecosystems. Three land-use treatments from the long-term ecological research site at Kellogg biological station in Michigan were compared with a nearby deciduous forest. Treatments included a conventionally tilled cropland, a former cropland afforested with poplar for 10 years and an old field (10 years) succession. We used soil aggregate and soil organic matter fractionation techniques to isolate C pools that (1) have a high potential for C storage and (2) accumulate C at a fast rate during afforestation or succession. These fractions could serve as sensitive indicators for the total change in C content due to land-use changes. At the mineral soil surface (0-7 cm), afforesting significantly increased soil aggregation to levels similar to native forest. However, surface soil (0-7 cm) C did not follow this trend: soil C of the native forest site (22.9 t C ha(-1)) was still significantly greater than the afforested (12.6 t C ha(-1)) and succession (15.4 t C ha(-1)) treatments. However, when the 0-50 cm soil layer was considered, no differences in total soil C were observed between the cropland and the poplar afforested system, while the successional system increased total soil C (0-50 cm) at a rate of 0.786 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Afforested soils sequestered C mainly in the fine intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (POM) (53-250 mum), whereas the successional soils sequestered C preferentially in the mineral-associated organic matter and fine intra-aggregate POM C pools.

  abstract: "A comparative N-15-tracer study of nitrogen dynamics in headwater streams from biomes throughout North America demonstrates that streams exert control over nutrient exports to rivers, Lakes, and estuaries. The most rapid uptake and transformation of inorganic nitrogen occurred in the smallest streams. Ammonium entering these streams was removed from the water within a few tens to hundreds of meters. Nitrate was also removed from stream water but traveled a distance 5 to 10 times as long, on average, as ammonium. Despite low ammonium concentration in stream water, nitrification rates were high, indicating that small streams are potentially important sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide. During seasons of high biological activity, the reaches of headwater streams typically export downstream Less than half of the input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from their watersheds. "

  abstract: "Radar backscatter measurements of a pair of adjacent soybean fields at L-band and C-band are reported. These measurements, which are fully polarimetric, took place over the entire growing season of 1996, To reduce the data acquisition burden, these measurements were restricted to 45 degrees in elevation and to 45 degrees in azimuth with respect to the row direction. Using the first order radiative transfer solution as a form for the model of the data, four parameters were extracted from the data for each frequency/polarization channel to provide a least squares fit to the model. Ebr inversion, particular channel combinations were regressed against the soil moisture and area density of vegetation water mass. Using L-band cross-polarization and VV-polarization, the vegetation water mass can be regressed with an R-2 = 0.867 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0678 kg/m(2), Similarly, while a number of channels, or combinations of channels, can be used to invert for soil moisture, the best combination observed, namely, L-band VV-polarization, C-band HV- and VV-polarizations, can achieve a regression coefficient of R-2 = 0.898 and volumetric soil moisture RMSE of 1.75%.

  abstract: Understanding the fate of environmental contaminants is of fundamental importance in the development and evaluation of effective remediation strategies. Among the factors influencing the transport of these contaminants are the chemical speciation of the sample and the chemical and physical attributes of the surrounding medium. Characterization of the spatial distribution and chemical speciation at micron and submicron resolution is essential for studying the microscopic physical, geological, chemical, and biological interfaces that play a crucial role in determining contaminant fate and mobility. Hard x-ray spectroscopy and imaging are powerful techniques for the element-specific investigation of complex environmental samples at the needed micron and submicron resolution. An important advantage of these techniques result from the large penetration depth of hard x-rays in water. This minimizes the requirements for sample preparation and allows the detailed study of hydrated samples. This paper discuses some current problems in environmental science that can be addressed by using synchrotron- based x-ray imaging and spectroscopy. These concepts are illustrated by the results of recent x-ray microscopy studies at the Advanced Photon Source.

  abstract: "Remotely sensed data can aid in estimating biophysical variables of corn (Zea mays L.). This study identifies spectral wavelengths, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and timing needed for estimating yield and leaf area index (LAI) for corn. Canopy reflectance (460-810 nm range) was measured periodically in 1999 and 2000 within a field study varying N and irrigation management for corn. Corn grain yield was strongly related to canopy reflectance for either individual wavelengths or for SVIs, reaching an optimum (R-2 &gt; 0.9) at R5 dent stage in both years. Green reflectance based on simple ratio (green simple ratio index, GSRI) had the highest R-2, lowest RMSE, and most consistent slope and intercept between years. In contrast, LAI was best predicted by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (RSME = 0.426) while green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) performed poorly (RMSE = 0.604). Corn grain yield in this study was best predicted at stage R5 using the green simple ratio index. "

  title: Leaching of Disolved Organic Nitrogen and Nitrate from Agricultural and Sucesional Systems with Difering Land Use Intensities
  abstract: The magnitude and importance of disolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a vector for hydrologic N los has ben largely ignored in agricultural systems. It has only ben measured in the surface horizons even in the few forested systems where DON has ben studied. The KBS LTER provided the oportunity to measure and compare DON los betwen agronomic and forested systems. Teflon suction lysimeters were instaled in the C horizon under treatments 1-7 and in coniferous, deciduous, and old field sucesional sites. DON los in agronomic systems was low compared to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , but was 20 to 10% of total los in perenial crops and sucesional systems due to generaly low total N los. Nitrate and total N los tended to be greatest in the fal, but DON apeared to have no seasonality except in 3 treatments. DON concentrations were generaly around 1 mg/l , whereas NO3 ranged up to ~ 60 mg/l. Nitrate los was greatest under the four anual croping systems. The low and zero input treatments had significantly higher nitrate los than the perenial and sucesional treatments sugesting that increased N cycling, not inputs, are the cause.

  title: 
  abstract: "Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest, this relationship remains controversial. Here, we, present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the relationship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?).  A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richness-productivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous.(i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richness-productivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivity-diversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped relationships occurred most frequently (41-45% of all studies). A positive relationship between productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies Within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivity-diversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were especially common (65%) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems. "

  abstract: "Glomalin is a soil proteinaceous substance produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the information available concerning this protein has been collected in relation to its role in soil aggregation. In this study, we explored the distribution of glomalin across soil horizons, decomposition of glomalin, and relationship with soil C and N in an agricultural field, a native forest, and an afforested system. Glomalin was present in A, B, and C horizons in decreasing concentrations. Land-use type significantly affected glomalin concentrations (mg cm(-3)), with native forest soils having the highest concentrations of the three land-use types in both A and B horizons. In terms of glomalin stocks (Mg ha(-1)), calculated based on corrected horizon weights, the agricultural area was significantly lower than both afforested and native forest areas. As measured after a 413 day laboratory soil incubation, glomalin was least persistent in the A horizon of the afforested area.. In agricultural soils and native soils, ca. 50% of glomalin was still remaining after this incubation, indicating that some glomalin may be in the slow or recalcitrant soil C fraction. Comparison of glomalin decomposition with CO2-C respired during incubation indicates that glomalin makes a large contribution to active soil organic C pools. Soil C and N were highly correlated with glomalin across all soils and within each land-use type, indicating that glomalin may be under similar controls as soil C. Our results show that glomalin may be useful as an indicator of land-use change effects on deciduous forest soils. "

  abstract: I examined the role of land use history and soil drainage characteristics in influencing the development of a 27 year old-field plant community in southwest Michigan.&nbsp; A divergence in species composition that occurred within the field between 1964 (year of abandonment from agriculture) and 1991 is reflected in the current plant community as a distinct west to east zonation in the abundance of woody vegetation.&nbsp; A similar zonation among the early successional species dominating the field in 1970 indicates that the divergence may be related to the initial colonizing patterns of the dominant perennial grasses (Agropyron repens, Poa compressa, and Poa pratensis), and their differential impact on patterns of woody plant establishment.&nbsp; It appears that an early successional spatial segregation of Agropyron repens and Poa species was not strongly related to variation in soil texture but rather to the effects of pre-abandonment weed control practices.

  title: Management Implications for Predator Insects in Field Crop Ecosystems
  abstract: Research conducted at the Long Term Ecological Research Program for agricultural ecology and the Living Field Laboratory (both at the Kelog Biological Station, MI) has resulted in the recomendation of using corn-soybean-wheat rotation integrated with the use of cover crops. These practices provide a more eficient use of carbon and nitrogen with aditional environmental benefits aimed to minimize soil erosion and nitrogen leaching. Studies conducted with similar management practices in other crops systems have shown an important impact in the population dynamics of both pest and beneficial natural enemies. The experimental layout of the KBS LTER represents a unique oportunity to study the response of major groups of predators to a combination of habitat/management under the conditions of Michigan landscape. The objective of this work is to evaluate paterns of response of major predator groups to the management practices used for field crops in Michigan.

  abstract: "Soils with a history of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) treatment at field application rates and control soils with no prior exposure to 2,4-D were amended with 2,4-D in the laboratory. Before and during these treatments, the populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria were monitored by most-probable-number (MPN) enumeration and hybridization analyses, using probes for the tfd genes of plasmid pJP4, which encode enzymes for 2,4-D degradation. Data obtained by these alternate methods were compared. Several months after the most recent field application of 2,4-D (approximately 1 ppm), soils with a 42-year history of 2,4-D treatment did not have significantly higher numbers of 2,4-D-degrading organisms than did control soils with no prior history of treatment. In response to laboratory amendments with 2,4-D, both the previously treated soils and those with no prior history of exposure exhibited a dramatic increase in the number of 2,4-D-metabolizing organisms. The MPN data indicate a 4- to 5-log population increase after one amendment with 250 ppm of 2,4-D and ultimately a 6- to 7-log increase after four additional amendments, each with 400 ppm of 2,4-D. Similarly, when total bacterial DNA from the soil microbial community of these samples was analyzed by using a probe for the tfdA gene (2,4-D monooxygenase) or the tfdB gene (2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase) a dramatic increase in the level of hybridization was observed in both soils. Probes to the tfdC, -D, -E, and -F genes did not hybridize to the bacterial community DNA to any significant extent before or after 2,4-D treatment, indicating that pathways different from the canonical pJP4-encoded pathway at the DNA sequence level, and possibly at the functional level, account for the degradative activity in these soils. Quantitative hybridization data and MPN values were in agreement, indicating that most of the 2,4-D-degrading populations were detected by the tfdA and tfdB gene probes. The hybridization patterns detected in Southern analyses of bacterial community DNA indicated that a dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was selected and maintained in these soils. "

  abstract: "Engineering and modeling applications often require reasonable estimates of the upper and lower limits of plant extractable water. Laboratory measurements of these limits do not always coincide with field observations. Statistical models to estimate soil water retention can be complicated and usually are not based on field measurements. The objective of this work was to develop simple, generic equations to estimate the field-measured limits of the soil water reservoir based on soil survey data such as texture and bulk density. We used linear regression to estimate the gravimetric upper limit from sand and clay content; the volumetric upper limit can be estimated from the gravimetric upper limit and bulk density. We used non-linear regression to estimate the volumetric plant extractable water from sand content. The lower limit cart be estimated as the difference between the upper limit and the plant extractable water. We adjusted the predictions for coarse fragments and organic C and we placed reasonable upper and lower boundaries to our estimates. The equation for the drained upper limit has a RMSE of 0.030 kg kg(-1) and uses two coefficients. The equation for the plant extractable water has a RMSE of 0.030 m(3) m(-3) and uses three coefficients. We tested the simple model with an independent data set. The RMSE of our model was similar or better than that of a more complex statistical model. "

    I conducted three manipulative field experiments: 1) to examine the effects of living plant neighbors and accumulated plant litter on the recruitment and growth of target plants across gradients of plant productivity and community biomass, and 2) to examine the impact of nutrient enrichment, increased productivity and litter accumulation on species richness in southwest Michigan old-fields.
    Plant removal experiments conducted at eleven old-field sites showed that the surrounding plant community suppressed the recruitment and growth of three native grass species (Andropogon gerardi, Schizachyrium scoparium, Sorghastrum nutans) across a wide range of productivity.&nbsp; The net suppressive effect of the surrounding plant community on two of the three target species increased in magnitude with community biomass as predicted by biomass-dependent theories of plant competition.&nbsp; Non-linear dependence of net community effects on community biomass indicated that biomass-dependent theories of competition may be most applicable to narrow ranges of low productivity.&nbsp; The degree to which the effects of plant litter contributed to the net effect of the plant community on target plant performance depended on the life history stage examined.&nbsp; Inhibitory litter effects on seedling recruitment increased with community biomass and contributed to the net effect of the community on recruitment at sites of intermediate community biomass, but litter had little impact on established transplants at any of the sites.&nbsp; 
    In a two-year experiment carried out in a grass-dominated old-field, nitrogen enrichment increased living plant and litter biomass and reduced species richness by inhibiting the colonization of forb species.&nbsp; Community responses to litter removal and litter addition treatments that were carried out in conjunction with nitrogen enrichment showed that declines in species richness and forb density were due to effects associated with increases in both living plant and litter biomass.
    The results highlight the potential importance of effects associated with both living plant biomass and accumulated plant litter in influencing plant recruitment, species diversity, and the distribution of native grasses across old-field productivity gradients.&nbsp; The general significance of these findings are discussed with respect to existing theories of plant community organization.

  title: Long-Term Croping Efects on Soil Phosphorus
  abstract: We evaluated the efect of conventional, no-tilage, and low-input organic row crop agriculture and perenial farming systems on soil phosphorus (P). We also compared soil P under conventional agriculture to an adjacent forest site in south west Michigan, USA. Sequential fractionation analysis of soil inorganic and organic P fractions (Hedley et al. 1982) was performed on treatments 1 through 8 of the KBS LTER plots and the deciduous forest. Long-term conventional row crop agriculture resulted in the reduction of NaOH-extractable organic P by 79% compared to adjacent forested sites (<a href="Figures/daroub_tab1.htm">Table 1</a>). The calcium phosphate pol and the residual P fraction on the other hand increased under conventional agriculture compared to the forest site, probably due to fertilizer inputs. The adoption of no-tilage and low-input organic based systems for seven years did not significantly increase organic P in any of the fractions extracted from the anual croping systems. However, organic P extracted by NaOH increased to 2.1% after the adoption of continuous alfalfa for the same period compared to 1.4% extracted in the conventional tilage treatment (<a href="Figures/daroub_fig1.htm">Fig. 1</a>). This increase was atributed to the turnover of the extensive alfalfa rot system. The residual P content decreased under alfalfa croping which sugests that alfalfa can take up P from this stable pol. Alfalfa may be taping into this stable pol not just for P, but perhaps for Ca released through apatite disolution. We conclude that continuous alfalfa can restore soils to their native P fertility levels by taking up P from the stable residual fraction and transforming it into moderately labile organic P through rot death.

  abstract: "Weed seedbanks have been studied intensively at local scales, but to date, there have been no regional-scale studies of weed seedbank persistence. Empirical and modeling studies indicate that reducing weed seedbank persistence can play an important role in integrated weed management. Annual seedbank persistence of 13 summer annual weed species was studied from 2001 through 2003 at eight locations in the north central United States and one location in the northwestern United States. Effects of seed depth placement, tillage, and abiotic environmental factors on seedbank persistence were examined through regression and multivariate ordinations. All species examined showed a negative relationship between hydrothermal time and seedbank persistence. Seedbank persistence was very similar between the two years of the study for common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, and velvetleaf when data were pooled over location, depth, and tillage. Seedbank persistence of common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, and velvetleaf from October 2001 through 2002 and October 2002 through 2003 was, respectively, 52.3% and 60.0%, 21.3% and 21.8%, and 57.5% and 57.2%. These results demonstrate that robust estimates of seedbank persistence are possible when many observations are averaged over numerous locations. Future studies are needed to develop methods of reducing seedbank persistence, especially for weed species with particularly long-lived seeds. "

  abstract: "Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. From 1991 to 1999, we measured gas fluxes and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystems. Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the Late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation. These results suggest additional opportunities for Lessening the GWP of agronomic systems. "

  abstract: "1 In this study the potential role of competition in influencing the distribution of three displaced native perennial grasses across complex gradients of plant productivity and species composition was investigated in Michigan old-fields. To do this plant removal and propagule addition experiments were conducted at nine old-held sites to examine the effects of living plant neighbours and litter on seedling establishment and growth of target species in relation to community biomass.  2 For two target species, Andropogon gerardi and Schizachyrium scoparium, living plant neighbours suppressed establishment from seed at most sites, and suppressed the growth of transplants at all sites. 3 Plant litter strongly inhibited the seedling establishment of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium at sites of high community biomass and litter accumulation, but had little impact on the growth rate of transplants at any of the sites. 4 The total suppressive effect of the plant community on seedling establishment and transplant growth of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium increased in magnitude in a non-linear fashion with community biomass. These effects increased in magnitude more rapidly across sites of low to medium biomass than sites of medium to high biomass. 5 The results suggest that these native grasses maybe restricted to low productivity habitats within this landscape because of strong competitive interference with establishment by the existing vegetation in the most productive sites.

  title: Carbon Gradients Within Soil Agregates of Agroecosystems
  abstract: Research into the biophysical mechanisms asociated with the formation, function, and stability of soil agregates is a primary focus of the Soil Biophysics Laboratory. The development of mini-Soil Agregate Erosion (SEA) chambers provides a unique oportunity for separating soil agregates into concentric layers. Multiple analyses of each layer are used to determine gradients for a variety of chemical, physical, and biological properties within the agregates. Quantities and forms of C within soil agregates are important factors controling agregate structure. In adition to the measurement of total C, gradients of <sup>13</sup>C concentrations are being measured. Plants with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways incorporate <sup>13</sup>C at diferent rates, therefore plants with contrasting metabolism deposit C with difering isotopic ratios into soil components. Consequently, delta <sup>13</sup>C ratios within concentric layers of soil agregates indicate the recent plant sources of soil C in contrast to C deposition by previous vegetation. Measurements of C gradients in agregates of the Kalamazo silt loam from KBS indicate a two- to thre-fold increase in the amounts of C within exterior layers of the agregates compared to the central regions of agregates. These concentric layer diferences are greater in no-til than in conventionaly tiled soils. Delta <sup>13</sup>C measurements indicate that up to 67% of the C in the exterior regions of agregates is derived from recent contemporary plant inputs. Similar measurements are curently being made on agregates from aditional experiments at KBS as wel as sites in Michigan, Ohio, Ilinois, and Minesota. Aditionaly, long-term incubations wil be performed to determine the rate of C turn-over from each concentric layer within soil agregates.

  title: 
  abstract: "The spatial distributions of selected soil properties in two adjacent sites in southwest Michigan were examined to evaluate the potential effects of chronic disturbance on resource heterogeneity. One site was a cultivated field that had been cleared, plowed, and cropped annually for decades prior to sampling while the other, uncultivated field was cleared of original forest in 1960 after which it was mown annually but never plowed or cropped. We took replicate samples from a 330-point unaligned grid across the sites for soil pH, gravimetric moisture, inorganic phosphorus, total carbon, and net nitrification and nitrogen mineralization potentials. Soils in the cultivated site contained less than half as much carbon as in the uncultivated site, but had higher levels of inorganic phosphorus and moisture, and higher soil pH. Potential net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates did not differ between sites. Geostatistical analysis showed that almost all properties examined were strongly autocorrelated within each site; structural variance as a proportion of sample variance ranged from 30-95% for all properties, and for any given property differed little between sites. The distance over which this dependence was expressed, however, was for all properties but pH substantially less in the uncultivated site (7-26 m) as compared to the tilled site (48-108 m), especially for total C and net nitrification and N mineralization. These results suggest that the spatial pattern and scale of soil variability can differ markedly among edaphically identical sites and that these differences can be related to disturbance history. "

  abstract: "We investigated temporal and spatial patterns of woody plant establishment in the first 7 y of succession in southwest Michigan old fields. From the 2nd to the 7th y following agricultural abandonment we conducted annual demographic surveys of woody plants and mapped all stems in six 10 x 20 m permanent grids co measure temporal and spatial patterns of woody stem emergence, mortality, density and species richness. Woody plant succession was characterized by increases in the emergence, density and richness of woody species over time and a shift from early dominance by and-dispersed species to later dominance by bird-dispersed species. The increase in abundance of bird-dispersed stems reflects both clonal reproduction by the dominant bird-dispersed species, Rhus typhina, and establishment from seed by a variety of other bird-dispersed species. Wind and bird-dispersed species differed in spatial pattern within the grids. Wind-dispersed species were distributed at random and bird-dispersed species were aggregated. Aggregation of bird-dispersed species was due to clonal stem production by R. typhina and the concentration of stems of other bird-dispersed species beneath the canopy of Rhus clones. The results highlight the importance of dispersal mode in controlling both the rate of woody plant succession and the development of spatial structure in plant communities. "

  title: An LTER Initiative to Facilitate Regionalization of Ecological Proceses
  abstract: "The LTER network represents larger physiographic, climatic and ecological provinces that include a diversity of ecosystems. In the LTER sites, including the KBS LTER, there are varying levels of emphasis on simulation modeling to scale up site research findings to the region each represents. To stimulate eforts to model regional ecological proceses for the 23 LTER sites, we are cordinating a set of workshops sponsored by the LTER Ofice in colaboration with the National Partnership for Advanced Computation Infrastructure (NPACI). The first workshop, entitled &quot;Modeling of Ecosystem Proceses at Regional Scales&quot;, was held at the San Diego Supercomputer Center in 198 to facilitate an examination of existing and developing regional models of ecological proceses. This workshop was highly sucesful in that it brought together modelers and would-be modelers of regional ecological proceses from 13 of the 23 LTER Sites. The outcome of the SDSC Workshop was to encourage the LTER Comunity to: Continue to develop models that simulate ecological proceses at regional scales that represent the LTER sites; Develop strategies and protocols for model code archiving, data management, and visualization of model results; Develop network capacity to enable modelers at LTER Sites to operate simulation models resident on computers at the SDSC and to pipe visual results of the model output back to LTER Sites; Select examples of models that acomplish the above objectives and demonstrate the model systems at LTER 20A second workshop is being prepared for the LTER Al-Scientists Year 20 Meting to inform the LTER Research Comunity of the activities aimed at developing strategies to build and use regional models to characterize the Region represented by LTER sites. The objectives of this workshop are to:Demonstrate each of the models using local computational capacities and remote model operation based on interconection with the SDSC facilities; Describe model operational structure to asist other LTER model developers to utilize SDSC facilities; Demonstrate data management of model output and scientific visualization; Discus future directions of LTER Regional Modeling activities.The KBS LTER (Gage, Colunga, Skole, and Safir) wil participate in this workshop using the CMAIZE model as a case study to demonstrate the use of a modeling interface to remotely manage model input/output data and to visualize the results."

  abstract: "Detailed studies of stream N uptake were conducted in a prairie reach and gallery forest reach of Kings Creek on the Konza Prairie Biological Station. Nutrient uptake rates were measured with multiple short-term enrichments of NO3- and NH4+ at constant addition rates in the spring and summer of 1998. NH4+ uptake was also measured with N-15-NH4+ tracer additions and short-term unlabeled NH4+ additions at 12 stream sites across North America. Concurrent addition of a conservative tracer was used to account for dilution in all experiments. NH4+ uptake rate per unit area (U-t) was positively correlated to nutrient concentration across all sites (r(2) = 0.41, log-log relationship). Relationships between concentration and U-t were used to determine whether the uptake was nonlinear (i.e., kinetic uptake primarily limited by the biotic capacity of microorganisms to accumulate nutrients) or linear (e.g., limited by mass transport into stream biofilms). In all systems, U-t was lower at ambient concentrations than at elevated concentrations. Extrapolation from uptake measured from a series of increasing enrichments could be used to estimate ambient U-t Linear extrapolation of U-t assuming the relationship passes through the origin and rates measured at 1 elevated nutrient concentration underestimated ambient U-t by similar to3-fold. Uptake rates were saturated under some but not all conditions of enrichment; in some cases there was no saturation up to 50 mumol/L. The absolute concentration at which U-t was saturated in Kings Creek varied among reaches and nutrients. Uptake rates of NH4+ at ambient concentrations in all streams were higher than would be expected, assuming U-t does not saturate with increasing concentrations. At ambient nutrient concentrations in unpolluted streams, U-t is probably limited to some degree by the kinetic uptake capacity of stream biota. Mass transfer velocity from the water column is generally greater than would be expected given typical diffusion rates, underscoring the importance of advective transport. Given the short-term spikes in nutrient concentrations that can occur in streams (e.g., in response to storm events), U-t may not saturate, even at high concentrations. "

  title: 
  abstract: "In order to better understand the spatial distributions of soil trophic groups and the potential significance of these distributions to ecosystem functioning we initiated a study to-describe the within-site variability of nematode feeding groups in a row-crop ecosystem. Soil cores were removed from a 48-ha corn (Zea mays) held in the U.S. Midwest prior to spring planting, and nematodes were identified by phenotypic criteria to four groups: bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores/predators, and plant parasites. Within-site variability was high for all groups; population counts spanned two orders of magnitude, with coefficients of variation ranging from 40-130% (n = 115-138 soil samples). Probability distributions were strongly lognormal. Geostatistical analysis showed that a major part of this variability was spatially dependent; variograms suggest that 70-99% of sample population variance was related to spatial autocorrelation over our geographic range of 6-80 m, except for the parasitic group, for which we detected no autocorrelation to 1200 m. Maps of nonparasitic feeding groups across the field showed large multi-hectare areas of low to moderate population densities, with sub-hectare clusters of high-density populations towards one end of the site. Individual feeding groups were only weakly correlated with one another across the held (Kendall's tau less than or equal to 0.363, P &lt; 0.001). Edaphic factors (bulk density, texture, pH, C availability, N availability) could collectively explain &lt;30% of the variability in the nonparasitic groups across the area sampled.  Results suggest that important soil food web components are strongly patterned at subhectare scales in this site. That this patterning is maintained in an ecosystem subjected to the homogenizing influences of annual soil tillage and a monoculture plant population is remarkable, and suggests that such patterning may be even more common in less-disturbed sites. Inclusion of these patterns in studies of ecosystem processes and soil community dynamics may significantly improve soil trophic models and our understanding of the relationship between soil populations and ecosystem function.

  title: Relationships Betwen Plant Comunity Composition and Soil Microbial Comunities on the KBS LTER
  abstract: The structure of microbial comunities in naturaly vegetated systems has ben asumed to be driven by botom-up forces; i.e., the quality, quantity and availability of plant-derived resources. We tested the hypothesis that plant composition, in particular the identity of the dominant species, plays a larger role in determining microbial comunity structure than plant diversity. Thre comunity types on the KBS LTER were sampled in 197; sucesional oldfields (T7) and poplars (T5) with and without (herbicide treated) herbaceous weds. Herbaceous plant composition and biomas, poplar wody biomas increment, and anual leaf liter biomas was used to ases plant comunity similarity and total anual net primary productivity (ANP). Soils were sampled in six replicate sucesional plots in mid-August at two spatial scales; acros the entire 1 ha plot and within a 1m x 10 m strip located in the interior of the plot. Soil samples in the wedy and wed-fre poplars were colected from microplots (aprox. 15m x 15m)in mid-September.&nbsp; Soils were sampled to a depth of 15 cm and sieved to 4m prior to analysis.&nbsp; The soil microbial comunities were diferentiated based on Faty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiles and the comunity potential use of 23 single carbon substrates (Biolog).In 197 ANP varied among the plant comunities ranging from273-820 g/m2/yr. The wedy poplar comunity had the highest total productivity (wod, leaves, herbaceous biomas), and the wed-fre poplars the lowest. Although herbaceous species richnes was higher in the sucesional old fields than the wedy poplars (19 vs 13), plant composition was similar. This result sugests that the majority of diference betwen the sucesional oldfields and wedy poplars is the presence of poplar tres and rots. Soil microbes in these thre plant comunity types tended to diferentiate based on their FAME profiles, with the wedy poplar comunity intermediate to that of the sucesional and wed-fre poplar comunities. Microbial comunities in wedy and wed-fre poplars had distinct paterns of potential C-source utilization from the comunity in the sucesional oldfields. This diference, based on the relative utilization of two amino acids, L-asparagine and putrescine, sugests that the microbial comunity is responding to rhizosphere products and exudates of the poplar tres.For the plant comunity types examined, the soil microbial comunities reflected diferences in plant species composition, particular the presence of a biomas dominant. There were some diferences in microbial composition betwen the wed-fre poplars (a monoculture) and wedy poplars (species richnes =14), sugesting that species diversity may have played a role as wel in structuring the microbial comunities.

  title: 
  abstract: Stoichiometric analyses can be used to investigate the linkages between N and C cycles and how these linkages influence biogeochemistry at many scales, from components of individual ecosystems up to the biosphere. N-specific NH4+ uptake rates were measured in eight streams using short-term N-15 tracer additions, and C to N ratios (C:N) were determined from living and non-living organic matter collected from ten streams. These data were also compared to previously published data compiled from studies of lakes, ponds, wetlands, forests, and tundra. There was a significant negative relationship between C:N and N-specific uptake rate; C:N could account for 41% of the variance in N-specific uptake rate across all streams, and the relationship held in five of eight streams. Most of the variation in N-specific uptake rate was contributed by detrital and primary producer compartments with large values of C:N and small values for N-specific uptake rate. In streams, particulate materials are not as likely to move downstream as dissolved N, so if N is cycling in a particulate compartment, N retention is likely to be greater. Together, these data suggest that N retention may depend in part on C:N of living and non-living organic matter in streams. Factors that alter C:N of stream ecosystem compartments, such as removal of riparian vegetation or N fertilization, may influence the amount of retention attributed to these ecosystem compartments by causing shifts in stoichiometry. Our analysis suggests that C:N of ecosystem compartments can be used to link N-cycling models across streams.

  abstract: "Agriculture meets a major human need and both affects and depends on all other life support systems. Current trends point to continued human population growth and ever higher levels of consumption as the global economy expands. This will stress the capacity of agriculture to meet food needs without further sacrificing the environmental integrity of local landscapes and the global environment. Agriculture's main challenge for the coming decades will be to produce sufficient food and fiber for a growing global population at an acceptable environmental cost. This challenge requires an ecological approach to agriculture that is largely missing from current management and research portfolios. Crop and livestock production systems must be managed as ecosystems, with management decisions fully informed of environmental costs and benefits. Currently, too little is known about important ecological interactions in major agricultural systems and landscapes and about the economic value of the ecosystem services associated with agriculture. To create agricultural landscapes that are managed for multiple services in addition to food and fiber will require integrative research, both ecological and socioeconomic, as well as policy innovation and public education.

  title: 
  abstract: "Fertilization experiments in plant communities are often interpreted in the context of a hump-shaped relationship between species richness and productivity. We analyze results of fertilization experiments from seven terrestrial plant communities representing a productivity gradient (arctic and alpine tundra, two old-field habitats, desert, short- and tall-grass prairie) to determine if the response of species richness to experimentally increased productivity is consistent with the hump-shaped curve. In this analysis, we compared ratios of the mean response in nitrogen-fertilized plots to the mean in control plots for aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and species density (D; number of species per plot of fixed unit area). In general, ANPP increased and plant species density decreased following nitrogen addition, although considerable variation characterized the magnitude of response. We also analyzed a subset of the data limited to the longest running studies at each site (greater than or equal to 4 yr), and found that adding 9 to 13 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (the consistent amount used at all sites) increased ANPP in all communities by approximately 50% over control levels and reduced species density by approximately 30%. The magnitude of response of ANPP and species density to fertilization was independent of initial community productivity. There was as much variation in the magnitude of response among communities within sites as among sites, suggesting community-specific mechanisms of response. Based on these results, we argue that even long-term fertilization experiments are not good predictors of the relationship between species richness and productivity because they are relatively small-scale perturbations whereas the pattern of species richness over natural productivity gradients is influenced by long-term ecological and evolutionary processes.

  title: History of land Use in Western Michigan
  abstract: This esay traces the history of land use in western Michigan, defined here as the Saint Joseph, Kalamazo, and Grand River valeys. It treats the history of land use as a function of shifts over time in economic systems-the values and behavior structuring the ways that people secure their livelihods. The logic of treating the river valeys as a regional unit of analysis is that they are part of the Carolinian biotic province and share a comon Native American, European, and Euro-American setlement history. The esay first characterizes a Native American semi-migratory, subsistence economy from the early sevententh century on the eve of European contact. Although it proved highly durable in its esentials, this economy was nevertheles shaped from the late sevententh century on by the Indians' involvement in the fur trade and, by the 1830s, by the arival of white setlers who eventualy displaced most native peoples from western Michigan. In the generation before the Civil War, these setlers practiced an economy known as subsistence plus surplus. The term signals the importance of long-distance trade in this economy, yet emphasizes that production for market does not outweigh household and comunal securing of the necesities of life. There were certain similarities on the frontier in western Michigan betwen this economy and the Native American economy as it had ben shaped by the fur trade. By 1860, however, the displacement of native peoples was complete. A transportation system capable of carying bulk gods cheaply and rapidly east was in place, and capital investments in frontier farms were suficiently great to transform western Michigan into a region dedicated to comercial mixed farming.

  abstract: "We used computer-assisted microscopy at single cell resolution to quantify the in situ spatial scale of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated cell-to-cell communication of Pseudomonas putida colonized on tomato and wheat root surfaces. The results of this in situ quantification study on close-to-natural surfaces challenge the conventional view of a quorum group requirement of high cell densities for this type of bacterial communication. In situ image analysis indicated that the effective 'calling distance' on root surfaces was most frequent at 4-5 mu m, extended to 37 mu m in the root tip/elongation zone and further out to 78 mu m in the root hair zone. The spatial scale of these calling distances is very long-range in proportion to the size of individual bacteria. Geostatistical modeling analysis implicated the importance of AHL-gradients mediating effective communication between remote cells. We conclude that AHL-mediated cell-to-cell communication occurs not only within dense populations, but also in very small groups and over long ranges between individual bacteria, and therefore this cellular activity is more commonplace and effective than hitherto predicted. We propose that this cell-to-cell communication is governed more by the in situ spatial proximity of cells within AHL-gradients than the requirement for a quorum group of high population density. "

  title: 
  abstract: Soil physical properties and the amount of soil water within a sloping landscape are largely determined by landscape position. This study determined temporal dynamics of soil water within a sloping landscape by (1) examining the spatial variability of selected soil properties that regulate water retention; (2) quantifying water balance by slope position; (3) determining the minimum amount of stored soil water data required to estimate the amount of soil water within a sloping landscape using geostatistics. Neutron probe access tubes were placed at two meter intervals, in two transects, across a sloping topography of Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic, Typic Hapludalfs) and Oshtemo sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed mesic, Typic Hapludalfs) at Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan. Volumetric water content of the soil was monitored approximately weekly in the spring, summer and autumn of 1990 and 1991 at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm by neutron attenuation. Soil samples from a 48 by 34 meter grid between the access tubes were described and sampled. Water content of each sample point was estimated with CERES Maize for two sample dates. Selected volumetric water per 150 cm soil depth values were removed from the data sets, then kriged and cokriged for mm soil water at locations where data points were removed. The Ap horizon of the lower backslope, footslope, and toeslope display a greater mean thickness, percent silt and organic carbon, relative to upslope soils. The Bt l horizon and control-section display a greater mean silt and clay below the middle of the backslope. The amount of soil water was least within the upper backslope position, moderate within the summit and lower backslope positions, and greatest within the footslope and toeslope positions. Cokriging estimation of stored soil water, using mm soil water per 150 cm soil depth at field capacity as the auxiliary variable, reduced the required sample distance to twice the range of spatial dependence in the direction parallel to the contour of the slope. Variogram models of the amount of soil water from large data sets could be used to predict the amount of soil water in other studies with similar landscape and soil conditions.

  abstract: "The maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for long-term productivity. Simulation models of SOC dynamics are valuable tools in predicting the impacts of climate on carbon storage and developing management strategies for the mitigation of Greenhouse gas emissions, however, their utility is Generally reduced due to need for specific data. The SOCRATES model is a simple process based representation of soil SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, which requires minimal data inputs and specifically designed to examine the impact of land use and land use change on soil carbon storage. SOCRATES was successful in predicting SOC change at eighteen long-term crop, pasture and forestry trials from North America, Europe and Australasia. These trials ranged from 8 to 86 years in duration, over a wide range of climates and soil types with annual changes in SOC ranging from -3.0 to 4.2%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. "

  title: LTER Agronomic Grain Yield and GIS Yield Monitoring
  abstract: "Agronomic yield is evaluated for each of the anualy tiled croping systems each year. The anual croped systems are in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation. In 198, the anual croping systems treatment rotated into wheat. The anual croped treatments are replicated six times and include Treatment 1, CT-Conventional Chemical Input/Conventional Tiled, Treatment 2, NT-Conventional Chemical Input/No Tilage, Treatment 3, LI-Low Chemical Input/Conventional Tilage, and Treatment 4, ZI-Zero Chemical Input/Conventional Tilage. Treatment 5 (Poplars) were harvested in the early spring of 19. The tres were chiped and weighed at the KBS Dairy. Treatment 6 (alfalfa) was replanted to a Leaf Hoper Resistant variety this spring. Diferences in anual croping systems and how each is managed influence final grain yield (<a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig1.htm\">Fig. 1</a>). Since 196 grain yields on the LTER Main site have ben estimated using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS system uses 24 earth orbiting satelites to determine the JD 425 Combines location during the harvesting operation with sub-meter acuracy. The cordinates are aded to yield information in 1 second intervals and this data is used to generate yield maps folowing the harvesting operation. The yield monitor within the combine is conected to various electronic sensors within the combine and is calibrated prior to harvest for each crop. The yield monitor gives acurate on the go information to the combine operator during the harvest operation and this data is recorded and downloaded to a computer at the end of each harvest day. In 198, al four treatments were evaluated for wheat yield acros al six replicates; grain weights compared to actual grain weight by plot had generaly les than 2% eror. In 196-corn , 197-soybean and 198 wheat harvests, the first four replicates of al four treatments were recorded (some of reps 5 and 6) using the yield monitor. The 196 yield monitor data has ben corected for moisture and grain yield by plot and re-maped. The 196 &#150; 198 GIS yield monitoring data is available on the LTER web page and include geo-statistical analysis of this spatial data and are available at: htp:/lter.kbs.msu.edu/Yield_Data/index.html. Yield monitoring base data, frequency distributions, variograms, kriged data, cros validation of kriged data, isopleth map, and the GS+ file are available for each LTER plot where real-time corected GIS data was colected and can be viewed at this site.The JD 425 combine wil be available for demonstration and yield maps for Treatment 3, Replicate 3 for 196-corn, 197-soybean, and 198-wheat apear in <a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig2.htm\">Fig. 2</a> and in <a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig3.htm\">Fig. 3</a>. These maps demonstrate similar yield trends for yields at a location and acros years for diferent crops. These spatial similarities for yield show how changes in soil type influences final grain yields and these diferences can also be picked up by loking at the low level infrared fly-over photographs taken each year prior to harvest."

  abstract: "We examined the impacts on U.S. agriculture of transient climate change as simulated by 2 global general circulation models focusing on the decades of the 2030s and 2090s. We examined historical shifts in the location of crops and trends in the variability of U.S. average crop yields, finding that non-climatic forces have likely dominated the north and westward movement of crops and the trends in yield variability. For the simulated future climates we considered impacts on crops, grazing and pasture, livestock, pesticide use, irrigation water supply and demand, and the sensitivity to international trade assumptions, finding that the aggregate of these effects were positive for the U.S. consumer but negative, due to declining crop prices, for producers. We examined the effects of potential changes in El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and impacts on yield variability of changes in mean climate conditions. Increased losses occurred with ENSO intensity and frequency increases that could not be completely offset even if the events could be perfectly forecasted. Effects on yield variability of changes in mean temperatures were mixed. We also considered case study interactions of climate, agriculture, and the environment focusing on climate effects on nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay and groundwater depletion of the Edward's Aquifer that provides water for municipalities and agriculture to the San Antonio, Texas area. While only case studies, these results suggest environmental targets such as pumping limits and changes in farm practices to limit nutrient run-off Would need to be tightened if current environmental goals were to be achieved under the climate scenarios we examined.

  abstract: "Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. These outbreaks are thought to be responsible for substantial cycling of nitrogen (N), and its loss from the system. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations within poplar plots were manipulated over 2 years so that the ecosystem-wide consequences of catastrophic defoliation on N cycling could be examined. The quantities of N in leaf litter-fall, ammonia volatilization and soil N pools were estimated across the two seasons. Defoliated leaf biomass was estimated from experimentally derived approximate digestibility factors and added to the mass of senesced leaf to determine total annual leaf production. Throughout the growing season the defoliation treatment peaked at about 40% in year 1 and 100% in year 2. Rapid regrowth after defoliation meant that only 45% of the annual leaf biomass was consumed in the defoliation treatment in year 2, while control plots suffered about 20% consumption each year. In each year, defoliated plots produced 20% more leaf biomass and N than the controls, a phenomenon attributed to compensatory photosynthesis. No substantial losses of N via ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission or nitrate leaching were observed. Neither was there any sustained or substantial gain in the soils microbial biomass or inorganic N pools. These observations suggest that the defoliated poplars were able to compete with soil microbes and N loss mechanisms for soil N as it became available, thereby ameliorating the effects of defoliation on soil nitrogen cycling. We conclude from this study that the N mineralized from defoliation residues was conserved in this plantation ecosystem. "

  title: "The Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment: Progres Report for Eagle Crek"
  abstract: The Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX) is an NSF-funded cros-site comparison study that includes streams at several LTER sites acros North America. The KBS site is Eagle Crek, located near Augusta in Ros Township. At each site we performed whole-stream <sup>15</sup>N enrichment experiments for six weks, folowing standardized protocols. The <sup>15</sup>N was aded as amonium at levels that did not produce a fertilizing efect. The <sup>15</sup>N enrichment revealed nitrogen flow through aquatic fod webs as wel as molecular transformations mediated by microbial activity (e.g., nitrification). Al ten experiments were conducted in 197 and 198, and the LINX group is presently working on data analysis and publication of the results. Eagle Crek is one of the largest and most nutrient-rich streams among the LINX sites. In short-term nutrient aditions (N or P), uptake from the stream water could not be detected over a 50-m reach. Nutrient-difusing substrates did not stimulate algal growth, sugesting that low light availability due to canopy shading limits primary production within the stream more than nutrients do. Thus the stream would apear to act as a conduit for nutrients. However, the d <sup>15</sup>N of disolved amonium and nitrate changed markedly over the reach, revealing that these labile nutrients exist in a dynamic steady-state in which amonium is being produced and nitrified, and nitrate is being asimilated and/or denitrified, thus maintaining stable concentrations. Aquatic invertebrates in the crek, which are diverse and abundant, became labeled with <sup>15</sup>N to varying degres depending on their fod sources and growth and turnover rates. Insect larvae that scrape algae from hard substrates became most labeled, folowed by invertebrates known to be benthic particle feders. Filter feders became only slightly labeled. The <sup>15</sup>N enrichment was harder to detect in animals with the slowest turnover (fishes and clams), but measurements of the digestive gland of the clams did reveal isotopic enrichment. The results of this experiment show the relative importance of algal asimilation vs. microbial transformations in determining the fate of nitrogen in the stream, and provide a comprehensive picture of fod-web linkages and the relative roles of autochthonous primary production and alochthonous liter inputs in suporting stream fod webs leading to fishes.

  abstract: "The development of sustainable N management systems requires a better understanding of the contribution of on-farm resources to the active N pool size and its mineralization. This study explores the effect of substrate diversity on improving N supply through mineralization. A &quot;diverse system&quot;, consisting of a corn (Zea mays L.)-cornsoybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation with cover crops and fertilized with composted manure was compared with a corn monoculture with conventional fertilizers. Nitrogen mineralization was measured in situ and in laboratory incubations as was the ability of each soil to mineralize added compost and red clover (Trifolium pratense) residue in the 6th and 7th yr of rotation. Net mineralized N in the diverse system was 90 and 40% higher than that in the monoculture at 70 and 150 d of laboratory incubations respectively. Comparable response was found in situ where a 70% higher net mineralization was observed in the diverse system at 70 d. The 70 and 150-d mineralizable N pools increased over time, but the ability of soil organisms to break down additional substrate did not change as a result of system diversity. At 150 d of laboratory incubation, a synergistic effect was observed when 5 Mg ha(-1) of compost plus 5 Mg ha (1) of clover was added to either soil. The combination of the two organic materials mineralized more N than the sum of their individual mineralization results. A more diverse cropping system may increase the soil's capacity to supply N to a growing crop while maintaining desirable levels of soil organic matter. This is essential for the overall long-term productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems. "

We discuss the roles of predatory arthropods in field crops and set forth a conceptual model that we have followed to identify key predators in the soybean aphid system. We identify Orius insidiosus (Say) and Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) as potentially key predators and show our findings on their phenology in soybean fields and their impact on soybean aphid population dynamics.

  abstract: "It is well accepted that soil organic matter improves soil structure; however, current methods limit our knowledge of the many physical-chemical mechanisms that control the temporal processes of soil aggregation. A soil aggregate erosion (SAE) apparatus was designed to uniformly remove concentric surface layers of soil aggregates in an enclosed erosion chamber. The SAE was used to test for the presence of concentration gradients within aggregates of different soil types. The SAE method generally improved the separation of ion concentrations between the external and internal layers. Concentrations of C, Ca, and Mg were 8 to 19, 20 to 21, and 29 to 33% lower, respectively, at the external layers of aggregates for Haplaquoll and Hapludalf soils. Removal of surface layers had no effect on the tensile strength of soil aggregates. Therefore, we concluded that the SAE apparatus improves the separation of ion gradients within natural soil aggregates. Identification of the mineralogical, physical, chemical, and biological properties of this improved separation of concentric layers from soil aggregates should lead to further advancements in our knowledge of the functional mechanisms associated with the development and stability of soil aggregates.

  abstract: "The design of sustainable N management strategies requires a better understanding of the processes influencing the ability of soils to supply N to a growing crop. Although commonly ignored, the release of C by plant roots may have a tremendous impact on soil organic matter turnover under certain soil conditions. The main objective of this study was to determine if living corn (Zea mays L.) roots would increase the N-supplying capacity of a soil with an enhanced mineralizable N pool. A rotation of corn-corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in combination with cover crops and the application of composted manure were used to increase the mineralizable N pool. The N-supplying capacity of bare soil and soils planted with corn and wheat was calculated, and changes in N and C pool sizes were determined by laboratory incubations. Living corn roots increased the inorganic N-supplying capacity of the conditioned soil by &gt;50%. We suggest that this increase is caused by an increase in net N mineralization. This is supported by the considerable size reduction of the 70-d N pool in the soil planted with corn. No significant increase in the soil N-supplying capacity was observed when wheat was planted, indicating the possibility that this effect may vary dramatically among plant species. The contribution of corn and wheat root rhizodeposition to the active C pool and as energy source to enhance microbial activity and organic matter turnover is discussed. "

  title: 
  abstract: "Laboratory and field tests support the &quot;voltinism-suitability hypothesis&quot; of host selection at various latitudes as well as in local &quot;cold pockets&quot;: The best hosts for rapid development will be selected by herbivorous insects under severe thermal constraints for completion of the generation before winter. Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to &quot;phenological twisting&quot; of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with &quot;thermally constrained&quot; growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection.  Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent &quot;species-diagnostic&quot; trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone.

  abstract: "Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades. Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed. "

During video-recording, some non-root residue remained with the extracted fine roots, especially in samples from organic soils, where residue materials comprised partially decomposed straw and peat. In computerized image analysis, materials with length-to-width ratios of =3:1 were deemed non-root debris and discarded electronically. The 3:1 length-to-width ratio was chosen for distinguishing long thin root images from short organic residues. Results show that more non-root residue was recovered by image analysis than was recorded by dry weight estimation after manual cleaning. Length, surface area and volume averaged 15%, 18% and 24% of non-root residue in the manually fully cleaned samples (residue estimation 0%, i.e. no visible debris recorded visually) of fine sand soils (n = 80). Length, surface area, and volume averaged 20%, 25% and 33% (r = 0.55, p < 0.0001), respectively, of non-root residue in the organic soil samples with residues <10% (g residues/g roots and residues) (n = 71). Both root and residue densities were higher at soil depths of 0\x9625 cm than in deeper subsoils, where the percentages of discarded residue were highest. Electronic non-root separation effectively eliminated short and partially decomposed organic material that was hardly visible or otherwise difficult and time-consuming to remove manually."

  abstract: "A variety of organisms change their geographic locations during their life history, and many use the atmosphere to accomplish this shift. Biota that how in the atmosphere range from very small (viruses, bacteria, pollen, and spores) to quite large (weed seeds, aphids, butterflies and moths, songbirds, and waterfowl). As these organisms move, they experience meteorological and ecological conditions that occur at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We present an ecological scaling approach that integrates concepts and elements of spatial and temporal scaling to understanding aerobiology and provide examples of the ecological scales important to the long-distance aerial movement of organisms and associated biological events and processes.  An operational framework for ecological scaling of long distance biota movement is achieved by linking spatially-static ecoregion classification systems with temporally-dynamic measures of vegetation phenology. The ecoregions provide ecological boundaries for the phenological dynamics of plants. Operationally, this approach integrates the bi-weekly vegetation greening indices (NDVI) derived from AVHRR or TM satellite data (representing temporal scaling) with the less dynamic land cover-land use classification (IGBP) and the relatively static ecoregion boundaries (representing the spatial scaling). We argue that the correlation of the life histories of species, especially the timing of take-off to ecosystem phenology through meteorological-based variables and indices (e.g., degree days and moisture indices), allows for dynamic characterization of source ecosystems and can be used to parameterize atmospheric models to forecast the flow of biota in the air. The scale of these processes, the diversity of the types of biota involved in long-distance movement, and the complexity of the processes require systems thinking. We anticipate that this paper will stimulate studies to enhance our understanding of the flow of organisms in the biosphere. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. "

  abstract: "Management programs for major forest defoliators such as gypsy moths or forest tent caterpillars, and crop pests such as the European corn borer have shifted from broad-spectrum insecticides to more environmentally benign microbial pesticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis (foliage sprays and transgenic toxin expression in plant tissues). Phytochemically resistant host plants and natural enemies have been used as alternative pest management strategies (including generalist tachinid &#64258;ies such as Compsilura, viruses, microsporidians, and fungi), but all of these have some non-target impacts, as described from literature review. A sequence of lab and &#64257;eld studies were conducted to determine non-target impacts on native Lepidoptera in North America. The conclusions reached are that a decision not to spray Bt pesticides (i.e. to allow defoliation and natural pest outbreaks to run their course) could be as bad or worse for non-target Lepidoptera as the microbial insecticides would be. The important concept that must be maintained is that all pest management programs have some risk of negative non-target impacts, but it is the magnitude and relative importance that will remain the most critical issue for environmental impacts and pest management.

  abstract: "The CERES-Maize model was developed to investigate how variations in environmental conditions, management decisions, and genetics interact to affect crop development and growth. A tile drainage subroutine was incorporated into CERES-Maize to improve soil-water and nitrogen leaching under subsurface tile drainage conditions. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the soil-water, soil-nitrogen, tile drainage, and tile-nitrogen loss routines of CERES-Maize for file-drained fields in Iowa. An analysis was conducted based on information collected from a study of 36 plots consisting of five management systems during a 4-year period from 1993 to 1996; at Nashua, IA. The model was calibrated for each plot using data from 1994 and 1995, and validated using data from 1993 and 1996. Temporal soil-water contents and water flow from tile drains were calibrated to an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.036 cm(3) cm(-3) and 2.62 cm, respectively, compared to measured values. validation trials gave an average RMSE for soil-water and tile drainage of 0.046 cm(3) cm(-3) and 5.3 cm, respectively. Soil-nitrate and tile-nitrogen flows were calibrated, with an RMSE of 6.27 mu g NO3 g(-1) soil(-1) and 3.21 kg N ha(-1) soil(-1), respectively. For the validation trials, the RMSE for soil-nitrate content and cumulative tile-nitrate flow was 6.82 mu g NO3 g(-1) soil(-1) and 8.8 kg N ha(-1), respectively. These results indicate that the new tile drainage algorithms describe water and nitrate movement reasonably well, which will improve the performance of CERES-Maize for artificially drained fields.

  abstract: "Native hop vine borer (Hydraecia immanis) and introduced potato stem borer (H. micacea) populations in Midwest corn have reached noticeable levels near the Great Lakes plant community ecotone between boreal forests and temperate deciduous forests. The hop vine borer is more specialized in its diet and occurs in corn generally south of the plant community ecotone, whereas the potato stem borer is polyphagous and occurs in corn mostly north of the Great Lakes plant transition zone. We analyzed the genetic composition of each species using cellulose acetate electrophoresis and resolved 19 loci of which 6 exhibited fixed or nearly fixed allelic differences. We expect that this will be useful in determining the degree of hybridization where the two species become sympatric due to expected continued range expansions in Michigan, Wisconsin, and New York State.

  abstract: "Despite mycologists interest in its unique spore-dispersal mechanism, systematic studies of the genus Sphaerobolus have received little attention. In our previous work multiple gene genealogies indicated the existence of three divergent lineages in the genus Sphaerobolus, each representing a phylogenetic species. Macro- and micromorphological analyses of colony and fruit-body characters presented here confirmed that these three phylogenetic species correspond to two known species, S. iowensis and S. stellatus, and a newly discovered species. In addition, an expanded gene genealogical analysis is presented for the three species. The new species, named Sphaerobolus ingoldii Geml, Davis et Geiser, is described based on both molecular and morphological data. In addition, while S. iowensis previously had been reported in only two localities, we found that it is as common as or more common than S. stellatus in North America. Despite the considerable amount of DNA polymorhism found in all species, nested clade analyses of S. iowensis and S. stellatus indicated little phylogeographic structure in either species, perhaps due to heavy movement mediated by human activities.

  abstract: "The reasons that the northern tiger swallowtail butterfly Papilio canadensis does not move south of the Great Lakes hybrid zone, where it meets P. glaucus, may be largely due to natural temperature-induced stress on diapausing pupae, Temperatures of 36degreesC for only four days killed all P. canadensis (from northern Michigan) and most of the Papilio troilus, a species that lives south of the hybrid zone (sympatrically with P. glaucus). In contrast, interspecific hybrids (P. glaucus mother x P. canadensis father) had significant adult eclosion or pupal survival at both 30degrees and 36degreesC. All surviving hybrid pupae were only females (the heterogametic sex, which are known to express the prolonged diapause due to Haldane effects). The southern species, P. troilus, had almost all (81%) normal (non-deformed) adults eclose at 30degreesC, whereas only 20% of the A canadensis females and ca 30% or the A canadensis males eclosed to produce non-deformed adults. Unlike the case with P. troilus and P. canadensis, no hybrid females eclosed at 30degreesC (only males did). Unlike P. troilus and P. canadensis pupae, hybrid (female) pupae remain viable, some of which have already successfully emerged after the chamber experiments. A follow-up study using P. glaucus, P. canadensis (from Vermont), and their hybrids with more normal lower thermal regimes included (27degrees, 30degrees, 33degrees, and 36degreesC) again showed higher hybrid survival as uneclosed (living) pupae at 36degreesC. In addition, A glaucus and P. canadensis showed high mortality and wing deformity of eclosing adults at 36degreesC, suggesting that geographic source of the P. canadensis may reflect differential tolerances of the extreme 36degreesC temperature.

  abstract: "Weed community responses were examined in a maize-soybean intercrop, with and without nitrogen fertilization, in southwestern Michigan, USA. Weed suppression was observed when intercropping was additive. The depression in above-ground weed biomass was not due to a synergistic effect of crop diversity, but to the effects of crop density and crop type. Intercropping did not have a greater suppressive effect than monocultures on weed biomass when crop densities were similar to those in monocultures. Intercropping per se did not alter the diversity, species richness or composition of the weed community. The presence and density of maize was more important than soybean density or intercropping itself in affecting the weed community. Fertilization and the interaction between fertilization and crop type had few effects on the weed community. "

  title: 
  abstract: Studies on the occurrence and effects of specular reflection in midinfrared spectra of soils have shown that distortions due to specular reflection occur for both organic (humic acid) and non-organic fractions (carbonates, silica, ashed fraction of soil). The results explain why the spectra of CaCO3 in limed soils do not match published spectra and offer an explanation as to why the presence of inorganic C interferes with the development of calibrations for organic C. These results may also have implications for the use of mid-infrared spectra for quantitative and qualitative analysis of soils. For example, libraries of spectra collected by means other than diffuse reflectance would be largely useless for comparing mineral spectra to soil spectra. To obtain the best results with forages and grains, it is necessary to develop separate calibrations for different products, but this has not seemed to be a problem for diverse sets of soil samples with C contents of 0 to 5%. Mid-infrared calibrations have also appeared to be more robust than the corresponding near-infrared calibrations in that fewer outliers are found. However, the results discussed here indicate that at least for some soil types (e. g., large differences in mineralogy or C contents), separate calibrations may be necessary.

  abstract: "We determined the accuracy and reproducibility of whole-community fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis with two model bacterial communities differing in composition by using the Microbial ID, Inc. (MIDI), system. The biomass, taxonomic structure, and expected MIDI-FAME profiles under a variety of environmental conditions were known for these model communities a priori. Not all members of each community could be detected in the composite profile because of lack of fatty acid ''signatures'' in some isolates or because of variations (approximately fivefold) in fatty acid yield across taxa. MIDI-FAME profiles of replicate subsamples of a given community were similar in terms of fatty acid yield per unit of community dry weight and relative proportions of specific fatty acids. Principal-components analysis (PCA) of MIDI-FAME profiles resulted in a clear separation of the two different communities and a clustering of replicates of each community from two separate experiments on the first PCA axis. The first PCA axis accounted for 57.1% of the variance in the data and was correlated with fatty acids that varied significantly between communities and reflected the underlying community taxonomic structure. On the basis of our data, community fatty acid profiles can be used to assess the relative similarities and differences of microbial communities that differ in taxonomic composition. However, detailed interpretation of community fatty acid profiles in terms of biomass or community taxonomic composition must be viewed with caution until our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative distribution of fatty acids over a wide variety of taxa and the effects of growth conditions on fatty acid profiles is more extensive.

  abstract: "Sub-plots of hybrid poplars were experimentally defoliated using 10 million gypsy moth larvae. Half of the defoliated (and undefoliated control) plots were fertilized to see if this would ameliorate the predicted induction of carbon-based phenolic defenses in the regrowth leaves. In order to bioassay the leaves of the four different treatments, we employed a continuum of genotypes (different hybrids and backcrosses of two different species of tiger swallowtail butterflies) with different abilities to detoxify these allelochemicals. Based on our previous studies with phytochemicals from the Salicaceae plant family, Papilio canadensis was likely to consume and process all Populus spp treatments, whereas P. glaucus predicted to either not consume or else quickly die on all Populus treatment leaves. Hybrid and backcross larvae of these two butterfly species are known to have intermediate levels of esterase detoxication enzymes and would therefore be likely to provide a continuum or at least varying degrees of sensitivity in bioassays for even the most subtle induction responses in the regrowth leaves. This presumption was supported in the feeding and growth studies conducted at different times post-defoliation during the 1997 growing season in Michigan. "

  abstract: "We determined factors that affect responses of bacterial isolates and model bacterial communities to the 95 carbon substrates in Biolog microtiter plates. For isolates and communities of three to six bacterial strains, substrate oxidation rates were typically nonlinear and were delayed by dilution of the inoculum. When inoculum density was controlled, patterns of positive and negative responses exhibited by microbial communities to each of the carbon sources were reproducible. Rates and extents of substrate oxidation by the communities were also reproducible but were not simply the sum of those exhibited by community members when tested separately. Replicates of the same model community clustered when analyzed by principal-components analysis (PCA), and model communities with different compositions were clearly separated on the first PCA axis, which accounted for &gt;60% of the dataset variation, PCA discrimination among different model communities depended on the extent to which specific substrates were oxidized, However, the substrates interpreted by PCA to be most significant in distinguishing the communities changed with reading time, reflecting the nonlinearity of substrate oxidation rates. Although whole-community substrate utilization profiles were reproducible signatures for a given community, the extent of oxidation of specific substrates and the numbers or activities of microorganisms using those substrates in a given community were not correlated. Replicate soil samples varied significantly in the rate and extent of oxidation of seven tested substrates, suggesting microscale heterogeneity in composition of the soil microbial community. "

  title: 
  abstract: "North American Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae, these Papilio = Pterourus) have previously been described as having allopatric distributions separated by a narrow hybrid zone running from Minnesota to southern New England, and southward in the Appalachian Mountains (possibly to northern Georgia). Recent patterns of hybridization and introgression suggest a more complex interaction between the two, possibly even resulting in the formation of a new species (Pterourus appalachiensis Pavulaan N Wright, 2002). Recently, extensive northward interspecific introgression of P. glaucus-diagnostic traits has been observed in the hybrid zone. These include wing bands and other color patterns, the ability to feed on tulip tree leaves, and Hk-100 allozymes; all are autosomally encoded. However, there has been little northward introgression of certain other P. glaucus traits (such as facultative diapause and bivoltinism, and Ldh-100 allozymes, both X-linked; and the Y-linked melanic mimicry gene in females). Interspecific recombination of the X-chromosome has evidently occurred, as shown by discordant patterns of X-linked markers. The P. glaucus X-linked Pgd-100 and Pgd-50 alleles have introgressed 200-400 km north of the historical hybrid zone, yet the P. glaucus X-linked Ldh-100 allele has not. The allele frequency shift for both genes is more closely related to the 'thermal landscape' (i.e., accumulated degree-days above a developmental base threshold of 50 degrees F (=10 degrees C)) than to latitude. Delayed post-diapause eclosion of cohorts within the hybrid zone, e.g., the New York/Vermont border area, has produced a natural 'false-second generation' flight (a hybrid swarm of synchronous males and females, where 2300-2700 degrees F degree-days have accumulated each year since 1998) that is reproductively isolated from flights of both parental species. Moreover, the newly described P. appalachiensis exhibits a unique combination of traits. These include obligate diapause, a univoltine habit, and the Ldh-80 or Ldh-40 alleles (as for P. canadensis), the Pgd-100 or Pgd-50 alleles (as for P. glaucus), and a delayed 'false-second generation' reproductive flight period (as observed in the hybrid zone). Since 2001, a rare allele or 'hybrizyme' (Ldh-20) has appeared in this false second generation at high frequencies (40-50%). We hypothesize that strong selection against the facultative diapause (od-)trait (and the linked Ldh-100 allele) in regions with 2800 degrees F degree-days or less, and divergent selection in favor of Pgd-100 (or a closely linked trait) combined with allochronic reproductive isolation, has resulted in recombinational, parapatric, hybrid speciation. There is no evidence at present that host-plant shifts or changes in sex pheromones have driven this process, in contrast to many other speciation events in the Lepidoptera. "

Larvae, obtained from females captured in Georgia and North Carolina, were fed leaves of either tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipfera) or black cherry (Prunus serotina) in experiments that either included a pre-treatment dip and rinse in 5% chlorox bleach or not, before the application of Btk (dipping leaves in serially diluted solutions of Foray 48B). The results show no difference between North Carolina and Georgia P. glaucus larval dosage sensitivities, but do illustrate a clear dosage effect for all 4 treatments (cherry with and without bleach pre-treatment; tulip tree with and without bleach pre-treatment). The larvae on the bleached leaves do not do better (for cherry or tulip tree host plant) as would be expected if microbial symbionts on the phylloplane synergize the Btk toxicity. These results show that Btk (at doses several thousand-fold less than aerial sprays across forests for gypsy moth control) will kill P. glaucus, with or without microbial synergism on leaf phylloplanes.

Slaked (i.e., sir-dried and fast-rewetted) and capillary rewetted soils were separated into four aggregate-size classes (&lt;53, 53-250, 250-2000, and &gt;2000 pm) by wet sieving. In rewetted soils, the proportion of macroaggregates accounted for 85% of the dry soil weight and was similar across management treatments. In contrast, aggregate distribution from slaked soils increasingly shifted toward more mirroaggregates and fewer macroaggregates with increasing cultivation intensity. In soils dominated by 2:1 clay mineralogy, the C content of macroaggregates was 1.65 times greater compared to microaggregates. These observations support an aggregate hierarchy in which microaggregates are bound together into macroaggregates by organic binding agents in 2:1 clay-dominated soils. In the soil with mixed mineralogy, aggregate C did not increase with increasing aggregate size. At all sites, rewetted macro- and microaggregate C and slaked microaggregate C differed in the order NV &gt; NT &gt; CT. In contrast, slaked macroaggregate C concentration was similar across management treatments, except in the soil with mixed clay mineralogy, We conclude that increasing cultivation intensity leads to a loss of C-rich macroaggregates and an increase of C-depleted microaggregates in soils that express aggregate hierarchy.

  abstract: "This study presents a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen (N) cycling in a second-order forested stream in southern Michigan that has moderately high concentrations of ammonium (mean, 16 mug N/L) and nitrate (17 mug N/L). A whole-stream (NH4+)-N-15 addition was performed for 6 weeks in June and July, and the tracer N-15 was measured downstream in ammonium, nitrate, and detrital and living biomass. Ancillary measurements included biomass of organic matter, algae, bacteria and fungi, nutrient concentrations, hydraulic characteristics, whole-stream metabolism, and nutrient limitation assays. The results provide insights into the heterotrophic nature of woodland streams and reveal the rates at which biological processes alter nitrogen transport through stream systems.  Ammonium uptake lengths were 766-1349 m and uptake rates were 41-60 mug N m(-2) min(-1). Nitrate uptake could not be detected. Nitrification rates were estimated from the downstream increase in N-15-enriched nitrate using a simulation model. The ammonium was removed by nitrification (57% of total uptake), heterotrophic bacteria and fungi associated with detritus (29%), and epilithic algae (14%). Growth of algae was likely limited by light rather than nutrients, and dissolved O-2 revealed that the stream metabolism was heterotrophic overall (P:R = 0.2). Incubations of detritus in darkened chambers showed that uptake of N-15 was mostly heterotrophic. Microbial N in detritus and algal N in epilithon appeared to reach isotopic steady state with the dissolved ammonium, but the isotopic enrichment of the bulk detritus and epilithon did not approach that of ammonium, probably due to a large fraction of organic N in the bulk samples that was not turning over. The actively cycling fraction of total N in organic compartments was estimated from the isotopic enrichment, assuming uptake of ammonium but not nitrate, to be 23% for epilithon, 1% for fine benthic organic matter, 5% for small woody debris, and 7% for leaves. These percentages agree with independent estimates of epilithic algal biomass, which were based on carbon:chlorophyll ratios in bulk samples and in algal fractions separated by density-gradient centrifugation in colloidal silica, and of microbial N in the detritus, which were based on N released by chloroform fumigations.

  title: 
  abstract: "Stable isotope enrichment experiments offer a potentially powerful way to examine the base of aquatic food webs, but interpretation of the data from these experiments may be confounded by problems such as selective ingestion/assimilation of bulk food sources by consumers, variable tracer enrichment over time, and the failure of consumers to approach isotopic equilibrium with the tracer in their diets over the course of the experiment. Our study examined data from a stable isotope addition experiment in which N-15-labeled NH4+ was added to a midwestern US stream. A compartment model was used to provide insights into the kinetics of N-15 uptake and release from algae, heterotrophic microbes colonizing detritus, and invertebrate consumers. The model accounted for temporal variation in the degree of isotopic enrichment and did not require the assumption of isotopic eqilibrium between consumers and their diets. The importance of instream production (i.e., growth of algae and microbes within the study reach during the experiment) relative to allochthonous and upstream inputs was similar to38 to 50% for heptageniids and Psephenus, 10 to 20% for Orconectes propinquus, Gammarus, hydropsychids, and larval Stenelmis, and &lt;10% for the filter-feeding Similium and the unionid mussel Pleurobema sintoxia. The alternative choices of algae or heterotrophic microbes as the basis of consumer diets made little difference in these estimates, even though the microbes became more IN-enriched than the algae because microbes had higher turnover rates. These results were subject to a number of caveats, and guidelines for experimental design are suggested for future studies to help address some of these problems. "

  abstract: "Highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) are long lived perennial plants that are grown on acidic Soils. The goal of this study was to determine how blueberry cultivation might influence the nitrification capacity of acidic soils by comparing the nitrification potential of blueberry soils to adjacent noncultivated forest soils. The net nitrification potential of blueberry and forest soils was compared by treating soils with N-15 enriched (NH4)(2)SO4, and monitoring nitrate (NO3--N) production during a 34-day incubation period in plastic bags at 18 degreesC. Net nitrification was also compared by an aerobic slurry method. Autotrophic nitrifiers were quantified by the most probable number method. Nitrate production from labeled ammonium ((NH4+)-N-15) indicated that nitrification was more rapid in blueberry soils than in forest soils from six of the seven study sites. Slurry nitrification assays provided similar results. Blueberry soils also contained higher numbers of nitrifying bacteria compared to forest soils. Nitrification in forest soils did not appear to be limited by availability of NH4+ substrate. Results suggest that blueberry production practices lead to greater numbers of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and increased nitrification capacity, possibly resulting from annual application of ammonium containing fertilizers.

  abstract: "Elevated atmospheric CO2 has the potential to change below-ground nutrient cycling and thereby alter the soil-atmosphere exchange of biogenic trace gases.  We measured fluxes of CH4 and N2O in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands grown in open-top chambers under ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations crossed with 'high' and low soil-N conditions. Flux measurements with small static chambers indicated net CH4 oxidation in the open-top chambers.  Across dates, CH4 oxidation activity was significantly (P &lt;0.05) greater with ambient CO2 (8.7 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) than with elevated CO2 (6.5 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) in the low N soil.  Likewise, across dates and soil N treatments CH4 was oxidized more rapidly (P &lt;0.05) in chambers with ambient CO2 (9.5 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) than in chambers with elevated CO2 (8.8 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1).  Methane oxidation in soils incubated in serum bottles did not show any response to the CO2 treatment.  We suggest that the depressed CH4 oxidation under elevated CO2 in the field chambers is due to soil moisture which tended to be higher in the twice-ambient CO2 treatment than in the ambient CO2 treatment. Phase I denitrification (denitrification enzyme activity) was 12 - 26% greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in the 'high' N soil; one sampling, however, showed a 39% lower enzyme activity with elevated CO2.  In both soil N treatments, denitrification potentials measured after 24 to 48 h were between 11% and 21% greater (P &lt;0.05) with twice-ambient CO2 than with ambient CO2.  Fluxes of N2O in the open-top chambers and in separate 44 cm2 cores &plusmn; N fertilization were not affected by CO2 treatment and soil N status. Our data show that elevated atmospheric CO2 may have a negative effect on terrestrial CH4 oxidation.  the data also indicated temporary greater denitrification with elevated CO2 than with ambient CO2.  In contrast, we found no evidence for altered fluxes of N2O in response to increases in atmospheric CO2. "

  title: 
  abstract: "The concept of ecosystem services (ES) provides a transformative lens for thinking about the relation between humankind and nature. The lens is especially revealing when applied to agriculture, the most widespread managed ecosystem on the planet. ES are defined as \"the conditions and processes through which natural ecosystems, and the species that make them up, sustain and fulfill human life\" (Daily 1997). By focusing on what ecosystems do for humans, the ES concept invites analysis of what humans do to ecosystems and why they do it.\n\n\
    Agriculture (including planted forests) conventionally supplies food, fiber, and fuel\x97\"provisioning services\" in ES parlance (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Farmers also help to maintain the natural \"supporting\" ES that make agriculture productive, such as pollination, biological pest regulation, and soil nutrient renewal. In theory, the same managed ecosystems that provide these marketed products could produce other types of ES if suitable incentives existed. The broad class of \"regulation ES\" covers climate regulation, water purity, surface water flows, groundwater levels, and waste absorption and breakdown. All of these offer benefits that are poorly captured by current markets, yet which managed agricultural and forest ecosystems could potentially provide. The same is true for the provision of habitat for wild species and the cultural, recreational, and informational ES.\n\n\
    In fact, compared to more natural ecosystems, agriculture and forestry have much readier potential to expand their supply of currently nonmarketed ES for three reasons: (1) much is known about biophysical input-output relationships in the system, (2) there exist precedents for economic incentives that could induce greater ES supply, and (3) the past performance of agriculture suggests strong capability to supply goods and services in response to attractive incentives. The rest of this paper expands on these themes by exploring the history of public awareness and reaction to ES linked to agriculture, some precedents for inducing farmers to supply a different product mix, the existing research base on agriculture as viewed from an ES perspective, and research needs in order to augment the provision of currently nonmarketed ES from agricultural lands."

  title: 
  abstract: "We investigated the effects of recent moisture history on the relative production of N2O and N2 during denitrification in soil from cropped and successional ecosystems. The soils were pedogenically identical but had been managed differently for the past decade. Sieved soils were amended with nitrate, glucose, and water. Long-wet and short-wet incubations received 80 and 0%, respectively, of prescribed water 2 d before incubation and the rest just before incubation. The N2O and N2 production and N2O mole fraction (N2O/[N2O + N2]) were measured using acetylene inhibition. The N2 production and soil 15N enrichment were measured by 15N-gas evolution. The response of N2O mole fraction to moisture history differed by ecosystem. Mean N2O mole fraction in the successional system was about the same for long-wet and short-wet treatments (0.34 and 0.33, respectively). For the cropped system, however, the N2O mole fraction was 0.36 for the long-wet and 0.90 for the short-wet treatment. Thus, in the cropped system a much smaller proportion of end product was N2O if soil had been wet for 2 d. For N2 fluxes, the isotope method gave the same pattern (r = 0.92) but only about one-third the magnitude, suggesting that N2 derived from two distinct pools. Differences in response of N2O mole fraction for successional and cropped soils may be due to differences in microbial communities. Further knowledge of ecosystem differences with respect to N2O mole fraction and recent moisture history may improve modeled estimates of local and global N2O fluxes. "

  abstract: "The intramolecular distribution of nitrogen isotopes in N2O is an emerging tool for defining the relative importance of microbial sources of this greenhouse gas. The application of intramolecular isotopic distributions to evaluate the origins of N2O, however, requires a foundation in laboratory experiments in which individual production pathways can be isolated. Here we evaluate the site preferences of N2O produced during hydroxylamine oxidation by ammonia oxidizers and by a methanotroph, ammonia oxidation by a nitrifier, nitrite reduction during nitrifier denitrification, and nitrate and nitrite reduction by denitrifiers. The site preferences produced during hydroxylamine oxidation were 33.5 \xB1 1.2, 32.5 \xB1 0.6, and 35.6 \xB1 1.4 for Nitrosomonas europaea, Nitrosospira multiformis, and Methylosinus trichosporium, respectively, indicating similar site preferences for methane and ammonia oxidizers. The site preference of N2O from ammonia oxidation by N. europaea (31.4 \xB1 4.2) was similar to that produced during hydroxylamine oxidation (33.5 \xB1 1.2) and distinct from that produced during nitrifier denitrification by N. multiformis (0.1 \xB1 1.7), indicating that isotopomers differentiate between nitrification and nitrifier denitrification. The site preferences of N2O produced during nitrite reduction by the denitrifiers Pseudomonas chlororaphis and Pseudomonas aureofaciens (\x960.6 \xB1 1.9 and \x960.5 \xB1 1.9, respectively) were similar to those during nitrate reduction (\x960.5 \xB1 1.9 and \x960.5 \xB1 0.6, respectively), indicating no influence of either substrate on site preference. Site preferences of 33 and 0 are characteristic of nitrification and denitrification, respectively, and provide a basis to quantitatively apportion N2O."

We accommodated analysis of N2O by modifying the head amplifier of our mass spectrometer. Our system accurately measured the 15N enrichments of labeled soil slurries for both N2 and N2O. In the field, we measured flux of N2 and N2O during soil denitrification from a 15N-labeled plot of winter wheat. Nine chamber incubations were conducted over 4 days. N2 flux ranged from below detection limit (&lt;0.022 g &middot; m-2 &middot;d-1) to 0.055 g &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1. N2O flux ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0027 g N2O-N &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1, with a detection limit of 1.0 &middot; 10-6 g N2O-N &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1. For N2O flux, the 15N-gas technique and gas chromatography technique agreed well (r = 0.98). The 15N enrichment of the soil mineral pool undergoing denitrification, measured nondestructively using the N2O data, dropped from about 0.82 to 0.72 atom fraction 15N over 4 days. Applying the 15N-gas nonequilibrium technique to N2O complements its use for 15N-N2 analysis when studying the relative production of N2O and N2 during denitrification. "

    Patterns and
    Consequences of Plant Diversity in Managed, Successional, and
    Natural Areas at the KBS LTER
  abstract: |-
    Understanding the causes and consequences of
    diversity has been a central question in ecology for decades, and
    has been the focus of increasing attention (and controversy) among
    plant ecologists over the past decade. Our past work on the KBS
    LTER has focused on documenting patterns of plant diversity
    (species composition and abundance) in the various treatments on
    the main experimental site. We plan to expand the scope of this
    work to examine directly the temporal and spatial patterns and
    consequences of plant diversity in the agronomic treatments,
    successional and more established communities in the region. These
    communities represent a broad range of ANPP and a variety of
    disturbance types and can be used to examine our hypotheses about
    the linkages between disturance (management), productivity,
    consumer-microbial diversity and ecosystem function. We plan work
    in four major areas: 1) the importance of seed banks as reservoirs
    of plant diversity, 2) the relationship between productivity and
    diversity in successional communities, 3) scales and patterns of
    diversity among managed and unmanaged communities, and 4) the
    consequences of plant diversity in row crop rotations. Summary and
    preliminary data related to these questions will be
    presented.

  title: 
  abstract: "Very sensitive measurements of N2 and N2O flux from soil are possible when gas evolved from 15N-labeled soil is analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.  This approach is useful for studying the fate of nitrogen fertilizer and for studying soil microbial processes contributing to the atmospheric increase of nitrous oxide, a radiatively active trace gas that can contribute to global warming and ozone depletion.  Most systems of equations that relate isotopic analysis to gas flux are sufficiently complex that certain limitations and potentials of the 15N approach may be overlooked.  We describe a graphical representation of labeled N-gas flux that illustrates the equations and encourages critical thinking regarding the implementation of related experiments.  This model is used to interpret underestimation that occurs if flux derives from multiple pools of differing enrichment.  A statistical derivation is presented for a previously published simulation of underestimation due to multiple pools.  The same equations are applied to field data to explore whether temporal variation in soil nitrate enrichment is likely to cause significant underestimation.  Two sampling strategies are proposed that may eliminate the assumption of pool uniformity, thereby eliminating a potential source of underestimation. "

  abstract: "The natural removal of NO3 by denitrification within riparian zones of streams and rivers is an area of considerable interest owing to its potential to minimize the impacts of excess anthropogenic loadings. In this study we utilize natural variations in stable N isotopic compositions of NO3- and NH4+ within a transect of shallow wells extending 4 m inland from Smith Creek, a southwestern Michigan stream, to provide insight into microbial processes and the extent of NO3- removal within a soil-stream interface. Within this region three water masses with unique biogeochemical characteristics intersect: a shallow flow rich in NH4 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a deep groundwater mass rich in NO3- but depleted in DOC, and stream water low in NO3, NH4+, and DOC. N isotope values for NO, within the well transect were highly variable (-7.7-34.1parts per thousand) and reflected intense microbial activity within this narrow region. Isotopic variation was primarily controlled by upwelling of deep groundwater near the stream and partial loss of NO, via denitrification that was dependent upon a supply of DOC from shallow groundwater.  Quantitative estimates of the fraction of NO3 removed due to denitrification within the soil-stream interface were obtained from N isotope data using a modified Rayleigh equation. Conservative estimates of NO3- removal range from 0% to 86%. In conjunction with measurements of hydrological flows within the sampling wells we provide a novel estimate of NO3- removal based only on natural abundance isotope measurements. NO3- removal was found to vary from undetectable levels to 123 mmol.L-1.m(-2).d(-1) for the narrow region of the soil-stream interface in which deep and shallow groundwater intersect. "

    Decomposition
    Rates of Wheat Straw Across a Network of
    Ecosystems
  abstract: |-
    The LIDET (Long-Term Intersite Decomposition
    Experimental Team) project was established in 1990 to examine the
    role of substrate quality and climatic factors on the decomposition
    and nutrient release dynamics of fine litter. Wheat straw is one of
    nine standard litter types distributed across the network of 28
    sites, encompassing ecosystems from tundra to desert to tropical
    forest. Litterbags are retrieved annually for a period of 10 years
    and mass loss, carbon, nitrogen, and lignin analysis are conducted
    at Oregon State University (OSU). Data are shared between
    cooperating sites via an electronic database system managed by
    OSU.Decomposition rates are lowest in the tundra
    (Fig 2.1) where both mean annual
    temperature ( - 2 C) and precipitation (2.4 cm ) are low. The
    highest rates are in tropical systems (Fig. 2.2) with mean annual temperatures
    exceeding 24 C, however precipitation ranged from &lt; 2 cm to 21
    cm with little effect on decomposition rates. Wheat straw
    decomposition at the source site, Kellogg Biological Station (Fig.
    2.3) is faster than three sites with similar mean annual
    temperature (Fig. 2.4 - 2.6).
    The faster decomposition rates at KBS may be attributed to the
    native microbial fauna and the annual addition of nitrogen
    fertilizer to the agricultural ecosystem.

  abstract: "The effects of enriched CO2 atmosphere on partitioning of recently assimilated carbon were investigated in a plant-soil-microorganism system in which Lolium perenne seedlings were planted into cores inserted into the resident soil within a sward that had been treated with elevated CO2 for 9 consecutive years, under two N fertilisation levels (Swiss FACE experiment). The planted cores were excavated from the ambient (35 Pa pCO2) and enriched (60 Pa pCO2) rings at two dates, in spring and autumn, during the growing season. The cores were brought back to the laboratory for 14C labelling of shoots in order to trace the transfer of recently assimilated C both within the plant and to the soil and microbial biomass. At the spring sampling, high N supply stimulated shoot and total dry matter production. Consistently, high N enhanced the allocation of recently fixed C to shoots, and reduced it to belowground compartments. Elevated CO2 had no consequences for DM or the pattern of C allocation. At the autumn sampling, at high N plot, yield of L. perenne was stimulated by elevated CO2. Consistently, 14C was preferentially allocated aboveground and, consequently belowground recent C allocation was depressed and rhizodeposition reduced. At both experimental periods, total soil C content was similar in all treatments, providing no evidence for soil carbon sequestration in the Swiss Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment (FACE) after 9 years of enrichment. Recently assimilated C and soil C were mineralised faster in soils from enriched rings, suggesting a CO2-induced shift in the microbial biomass characteristics (structure, diversity, activity) and/or in the quality of the root-released organic compounds.

  title: 
  abstract: |-
    <p>Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement in soils are two of a limited number of rapidly-deployable, high impact CO2 stabilization options now available to policy makers. Among agricultural management options, eliminating tillage may have the broadest mitigation potential because it alters emissions of all three biogenic greenhouse gases. No-till soil management in the U.S, although increasing, however, continues to be rotated with tillage because of perceptions that no-till limits N availability and decreases yields. This raises questions about the permanence of stored C, which has been identified as the fundamental challenge to terrestrial C sequestration. In this dissertation I address the ecological processes underlying soil organic matter permanence and the ecosystem and agronomic consequences of long-term no-till.</p>
    
    <p>In the first series of experiments, reported in Chapter 2, I determined aggregate-associated soil C pools in ten ecosystems on the same soil series along a management intensity gradient. I also assess the degree to which C is protected by aggregates using size and density fractionation techniques coupled with long-term mineralization assays of crushed and intact aggregates. Active pool C increases when 2000-8000 pm aggregates were broken into microaggregates (<250 p.m) ranged from 18% in conventional agriculture to 59% in alfalfa. Potential release of whole-soil labile C from physical protection following macroaggregate destruction was seven to nine-fold greater in successional systems than conventional agriculture.
    
    <p>In the second set of experiments, reported in Chapter 3-5, I cultivated a never-previously cultivated field and minimized plant community changes to look at soil disturbance free from the influence of other agricultural management practices. I infer soil C permanence from responses of aggregate-protected soil organic matter, enzyme activities that reflect soil microbial activity, and trace gas fluxes. I, therefore, attempt to advance our ability to predict tillage effects on soils by understanding the basic ecological processes controlling soil's response to disturbance. Cultivation immediately reduced 2000-8000 pm aggregates to levels commonly found in agricultural soils tilled > 50 years. The destruction of aggregates released particulate C from protected microsites and limited the incorporation of aboveground C into new aggregates. This lead to a series of biogeochemical transformations I term an aggregate cascade. Microbial activity and N cycling increase, substantially increasing fluxes of both nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Growing plants can modify the effects of tillage on N availability and N20 flux but have little effect on aggregation or CO2 emissions. This cascade is accelerated by increased soil temperature and other environmental changes following decomposition that promote decomposition.
    
    <p>In chapter 6, I report on an analysis of data from the till and no-till treatments of the KBS LTER and conclude that over 12 years there were no yield declines or environmental consequences (e.g. increased N20 emissions) associated with no-till. This work was performed in collaboration with classmates in a graduate seminar.</p>
    
    <p>My results show that cultivation immediately destabilizes physical and microbial processes related to C and N retention in soils. I also demonstrate that no-till cropping can be practiced with no yield or environmental trade-offs. Together, these results demonstrate the importance and feasibility of protecting no-till soils from periodic cultivation.</p>

  abstract: "Quantifying pathways of energy transfer between plants, pests, and beneficial insects is a necessary step toward maintaining pest stable agroecosystems in the absence of chemical subsidies. A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment '13C and '15N values of H. variegata (-12.0&permil; and 6.3&permil;, respectively) differed by -0.2&permil; and 2.9&permil; from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9&permil; and 8.8&permil; for '13C and '15N values, respectively). Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these beneficial organisms within agroecosystems.

    LTER Agronomic
    Grain Yield and GIS Yield Monitoring
  abstract: |-
    Agronomic yield is evaluated for each of the
    annually tilled cropping systems each year. The annual cropped
    systems are in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation. The annual cropped
    treatments are replicated six times and include Treatment 1,
    CT-Conventional Chemical Input/Conventional Tilled, Treatment 2,
    NT-Conventional Chemical Input/No Tillage, Treatment 3, LI-Low
    Chemical Input/Conventional Tillage, and Treatment 4,
    ZI-ZeroChemical Input/Conventional Tillage. Differences in cropping
    systems and how each is managed influence final grain yield
    (Fig. 1). &nbsp; Since 1996
    grain yields on the LTER site have been estimated using a Global
    Positioning System (GPS). The GPS uses 24 earth orbiting satellites
    to determine the JD 4425 Combines location during the harvesting
    operation with sub-meter accuracy. The coordinates are added to
    yield information in 1 second intervals and this data is used to
    generate yield maps following the harvesting operation. The yield
    monitor within the combine is connected to various electronic
    sensors within the combine and is calibrated prior to harvest for
    each crop. The yield monitor gives accurate on the go information
    to the combine operator during the harvest operation and this data
    is recorded and downloaded to a computer at the end of each harvest
    day. In 1998, all four treatments were evaluated for wheat yield
    across all six replicates; grain weights compared to actual grain
    weight by plot had generally less than 2% error. In 1996-corn and
    1997-soybean harvests, the first four replicates of all four
    treatments were recorded (some of reps 5 and 6) using the yield
    monitor. The 1996 yield monitor data has been corrected for
    moisture and grain yield by plot and re-mapped. The 1997 data is
    still being processed and we&#8217;re just beginning to look at the
    1998 data. The JD 4425 combine will be available for demonstration
    and yield maps for Treatment 3, Replicate 3 for 1996-corn,
    1997-soybean, and 1998-wheat appear in Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3. These maps demonstrate similar
    yield treads for a location and across years for different crops.
    These similarities show how changes in soil type influences final
    grain yields and these differences can also be picked up by looking
    at the low level infared fly-over photographs taken each year prior
    to harvest.

  title: 
  abstract: "Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a culture-independent method of obtaining a genetic fingerprint of the composition of a microbial community. Comparisons of the utility of different methods of (i) including peaks, (ii) computing the difference (or distance) between profiles, and (iii) performing statistical analysis were made by using replicated profiles of eubacterial communities. These samples included soil collected from three regions of the United States, soil fractions derived from three agronomic field treatments, soil samples taken from within one meter of each other in an alfalfa field, and replicate laboratory bioreactors. Cluster analysis by Ward's method and by the unweighted-pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) were compared. Ward's method was more effective at differentiating major groups within sets of profiles; UPGMA had a slightly reduced error rate in clustering of replicate profiles and was more sensitive to outliers. Most replicate profiles were clustered together when relative peak height or Hellinger-transformed peak height was used, in contrast to raw peak height. Redundancy analysis was more effective than cluster analysis at detecting differences between similar samples. Redundancy analysis using Hellinger distance was more sensitive than that using Euclidean distance between relative peak height profiles. Analysis of Jaccard distance between profiles, which considers only the presence or absence of a terminal restriction fragment, was the most sensitive in redundancy analysis, and was equally sensitive in cluster analysis, if all profiles had cumulative peak heights greater than 10,000 fluorescence units. It is concluded that T-RFLP is a sensitive method of differentiating between microbial communities when the optimal statistical method is used for the situation at hand. It is recommended that hypothesis testing be performed by redundancy analysis of Hellinger-transformed data and that exploratory data analysis be performed by cluster analysis using Ward's method to find natural groups or by UPGMA to identify potential outliers. Analyses can also be based on Jaccard distance if all profiles have cumulative peak heights greater than 10,000 fluorescence units. "

  abstract: "No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N2O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved.  We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N2O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn\x96soybean\x96wheat rotations between 1989and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO3- concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO3- concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m22 yr21 over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth.  Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 + 0.52 g N ha d-1) and no-till (3.63 + 0.53 g N ha d-1) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N2O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs."

  abstract: "The stability of soil aggregate structures is very important for controlling aggregate dynamics and associated biogeochemical soil processes that respond to management and other physical disturbances. We examined the mechanical strengths of concentric soil layers from the surfaces to the centers of individual soil macroaggregates and compared them with polar tensile strengths (T-s), total soil C contents, soil texture, and bulk density of aggregates. Aggregates were sampled at depths of 0 to 5 cm from conventionally tilled (CT), no tilled (NT), and native forest (NF) ecosystems of a Wooster (fine-loamy, mesic Typic Fragindalf) and a Hoytville (fine, illitic, mesic Mollic Epiaqualf) soils Erosive strength (E-s) of aggregates was defined as the surrogate for erosive forces required to remove 1 g of soil during 1 min from the Surface of a soil aggregate rotating along the abrasive wall of a soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chamber. Total E-s values of macroaggregates were consistent with T-s of whole aggregates and were controlled by aggregate size and treatment. The E-s increased with decreasing aggregate size and from the exterior to the interior regions of aggregates. Measured changes in soil C content, texture, and bulk density across the different regions within aggregates did not completely explain the spatial distributions of E-s among concentric layers within macroaggregates. Higher contents of C and clay contributed to the greater strengths of the Hoytville soil aggregates, regardless of bulk density. On the other hand, E-s of soil aggregates from coarser-textured Wooster soils were correlated primarily with bulk density and appeared to be independent of C content. "

    Landscape
    Biogeochemistry: A New Component of the KBS LTER
    Project
  abstract: |-
    One of the main ways in which environments
    interact at the landscape scale is through the fluxes of water by
    surface and subsurface pathways. Lakes, wetlands, and streams are
    abundant and diverse in the glacial landscape around KBS and
    represent an important recreational and aesthetic resource
    (Fig. 2.14). The central question
    we intend to address with our new landscape biogeochemistry
    component is "How do current and future land use and landscape
    patterns affect the fluxes of water and nutrients from upland areas
    to lakes, streams and wetlands?" Our studies of land-water linkages
    will benefit from the detailed understanding of terrestrial
    ecosystems provided by previous LTER research, as well as an
    extensive body of limnological research on local lakes and
    streams.We will measure hydrochemistry (major solutes and
    nutrients) at key points along hydrological flow paths, beginning
    with precipitation and including infiltrating soil water, ground
    waters, springs, streams, wetlands, and lakes (Fig. 2.14). The study area is defined as
    a watershed subunit that encompasses the LTER site and is bounded
    by Gull Lake on the west and Augusta Creek on the east (Fig. 2.14). Sampling will be performed
    over several years to reveal both seasonal and interannual
    variability. Spatially-explicit hydrogeological models will be
    employed to determine flow paths and transit times for subsurface
    water movement, as well as to simulate the loading of pollutants
    from various landscape units. In the future, changes in land use
    and landscape patterns associated with the increasing conversion of
    rural land to residential use will alter the magnitudes and
    relative proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from the
    land surface to lakes, streams, and wetlands. In addition, climate
    change will affect the water balance, most likely leading to dryer
    conditions during the growing season and decreased water tables.
    Our comprehensive understanding of water and nutrient fluxes across
    the local landscape will reveal how surface and subsurface water
    resources are impacted by these changes.

  abstract: "Differential selection in a heterogeneous environment is thought to promote the maintenance of ecologically significant genetic variations.  Variation is maintained when selection is counterbalanced by the homogenizing effects of gene flow and random mating.  In this study, we examine the relative importance of differential selection and gene glow in maintaining genetic variation in Papilio glaucus.  differential selection on traits contributing to successful use of host plants (oviposition preference and larval performance) was assessed by comparing the responses of southern Ohio, north central Georgia, and southern Florida populations of P. glaucus to three hosts: Liriodendron tulipifera, Magnolia virginiana, and Prunus serotina.  Gene flow among populations was estimated using allozyme frequencies from nine polymorphic loci.  Significant genetic differentiation was observed among populations for both oviposition preference and larval performance.  This differentiation was interpreted to be the result of selection acting on Florida P. glaucus for enhanced use of Magnolia, the prevalent host in Florida.  In contrast, no evidence of population strengths of gene flow and genetic drift, was large, indicating that genetic exchange among P. glaucus populations is relatively unrestricted.  The contrasting patterns of spatial differentiation for host-use traits and lack of differentiation for electrophoretically detectable variation implies that differential selection among populations will be counterbalanced by gene flow, thereby maintaining genetic variation for host-use traits.

  abstract: "Greater knowledge of intraaggregate porosity modifications by tillage conveys new information for identifying additional hydrologic, ion retention, and aggregate stability responses to specific management practices. Macroaggregates, 2 to 4, 4 to 6.3, and 6.3 to 9.5 mm across, were separated into multiple concentric layers and their porosities were determined. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of multiple aggregate fractions from two soil types subjected to conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and native forest (NF) soils were measured individually to identify the effects of tillage on aggregate structure, porosity, and K-s. Intraaggregate porosities were the highest in NF aggregates. Greater porosities were identified in exterior layers of soil aggregates from all treatments. Lowest intraaggregate porosities were observed in the central regions of CT aggregates. Soil aggregates, 6.3 to 9.5 mm across, had the greatest total porosities, averaging 37.5% for both soil types. Long-term CT reduced intraaggregate porosities and K, within macroaggregates, of the same size fraction, from both the Hoytville silty clay loam and Wooster silt loam soil types. Values for K-s of NF aggregates, 5.0 X 10(-5) cm s(-1), were reduced 50-fold by long-term CT treatments of the Hoytville series. The K-s values through Wooster aggregates from NF, 16.0 X 10(-5) cm s(-1), were reduced 80-fold by long-term CT treatments. The K-s values through NF and NT aggregates were positively correlated with their intraaggregate porosities (R-2 = 0.84 for NF and R-2 = 0.45 for NT at P &lt; 0.005). Additional studies are needed to identify rates at which pore geometries within macroaggregates are degraded by CT or improved by NT. "
