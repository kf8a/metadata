    <kbsml_text><h2>KBS LTER GPS Protocol</h2>
    
      <h2>Materials</h2>
    
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
    
      <p>The KBS LTER has two identical Trimble GPS units. "GPS I" is
      to be used exclusively by the KBS LTER staff. "GPS II" can be
      loaned to others with permission by the LTER Project Manager.</p>
    
      <p>Two components make up each GPS unit: the Trimble Data logger
      type TSCe with touch screen, and the Trimble Receiver Type Pro
      XRS model 33302-51.</p>
    
      <p>The GPS can be used in temperatures from -4 F to 140 F. The
      logger is designed to withstand accidental immersion so it should
      be fine to use it in the rain.</p>
    
      <p>The data logger is set to power off after 10 minutes of
      inactivity to conserve the batteries.</p>
    
      <p>Start, Settings, Control Panel, Power Off tab, &lt;On
      Batteries suspend after: 10 minutes&gt;</p>
    
      <h3>Software</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <li>TerraSync - Used for collecting and updating GPS data on
        the Trimble data logger.</li>
    
        <li>Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office (Version 2.9)- Used to manage
        and process GPS data on the PC.</li>
    
        <li>Microsoft Active Sync 3.1.0.9558 - Used to connect your PC
        to the Trimble Data Logger in order to transfer data.</li>
    
        <li>Omnistar is a GPS service that gives real-time
        differential correction. The Omnistar service will be
        maintained on "LTER GPS I", if funding allows. Omnistar service
        will not be purchased for LTER GPS II unless another user
        requests to borrow the unit and pays for the Omnistar service.
        See the Appendix for service details.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h2>Set Up</h2>
    
      <h3>GPS Mission Planning</h3>
    
      <p>GPS mission planning allows you to determine what time of day
      the satellites are in suboptimum position so that you can avoid
      collecting GPS data during these times. Mission planning is
      critical when collecting GPS data in forested areas or other
      challenging sites (see "Collecting Data in Trees or near
      Obstructions" in the Appendix).</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>The Planning Software should be installed on the two
        computer's in the Robertson Lab that have Trimble's GPS
        Pathfinder Office software, however, if it is not installed
        then do the following.

    LTER Weather Station Annual Maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to weekly maintenance, annual maintenance may be required for certain instruments.  <a href = "http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/Data/table.jsp?Product=KBS002-003&amp;limitBy=Location&amp;containing=LTERWS&amp;format=record">KBS002-003</a> lists the instruments currently deployed at the weather station.  Check the serial numbers in the field to verify that the list is correct.  Determine how long the device has been deployed by looking up its serial number in <a href = "http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/Data/table.jsp?tools=show&amp;Product=KBS002-004&amp;limitBy=Instrument&amp;format=record">KBS002-004</a>.  Service or replace the instrument as appropriate, referring to the instrument manual on file with the LTER Information manager (summary provided below).  Light, wind, and humidity sensors are typically rotated, i.e.,  swapped for freshly calibrated instruments of the same type, and sent to the manufacturer for recalibration.  Any time an instrument is removed or placed, the event should be reported to the information manager and logged in the instrument tracking system (KBS002-004).  All instruments should be monitored throughout the year, and replaced/serviced if suspect. </p>
    <p>Most instruments can be serviced from the ground, or by climbing a short distance up the tower.  To service wind instruments, a crew of four people can "drop" the tower.  Attach a rope halfway up the tower and have one person handle the rope to control descent.  Carefully remove the retaining bolts on the southwest leg, and lower bolts on the other two legs.  Tower will pivot on remaing bolts.  Slowly lower the tower toward the northeast, using remaining personnel.  Support lowered tower on saw horses to prevent damage to wind instruments or instrument enclosure.  Caution!  Tower is heavy.  Do not attempt this operation without sufficient help.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The quartz lysimeters are designed to pull soil solution at low suction (-0.5 atm or 38 cm Hg).  The soil
    solution (leachate) is harvested by attaching a sealed and evacuated flask to a small diameter sample line
    connected to the lysimeter.  Over a period of 24 h, the pressure differential between the soil solution and
    leachate collected within the flask reaches a state of equilibrium.  Flasks containing leachate are transferred
      to the laboratory.  The leachate is filtered with glass fiber filters, stored in polyethelene vials, and
    frozen  until analyzed for inorganic N and dissolved organic N using flow spectrophotometry.

    <h2>Overview
    </h2>
    <p>Above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) is measured at the KBS
    LTER in habitats ranging from annual cropping systems to deciduous
    forests. The diverse plant communities in these habitats require
    different harvest and/or sampling methods. All measurements are taken
    pre-harvest at peak annual biomass for major community
    components. This generally means physiological maturity for annuals
    and pre-senescence for perennials; most treatments are thus sampled at
    least twice per year depending on the life history of community
    components (e.g. corn vs. winter annuals in Treatment 1) and on
    agronomic harvest frequency (e.g. 3-4 times per year for alfalfa). If
    possible, biomass samples are taken from each of the five sampling
    stations within a plot, although labor, weather, and time constraints
    may alter the number of sampling stations for a given harvest.
    </p>
    <p>For Treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and SF (successional field) ANPP is
    assessed by harvesting all the above ground portion of plants that are
    rooted within the bounds of the harvest quadrat. The quadrat size
    totals 1 m <sup>2 </sup> but the dimensions vary depending on the crop
    row spacing in the annual systems (T1-4) and are described in Table
    1. The quadrat size for T5-SF is 0.5 by 2.0 m (1m <sup>2
    </sup>). Quadrats are oriented with the long side in an east - west
    direction. This direction is perpendicular to the crop rows (in
    planted systems) and allows for assessment of both the row and
    interrow plant communities. All plants within the quadrat are clipped
    at ground level, bagged, and stored at 4 degrees C until botanical
    separations are performed. Harvested plants are separated by species
    and identified using the five-letter Bayer code system (Weed Science,
    1984). Six letter codes are used for woody species, using the first
    three letters of both genus and species to create the code. In some
    cases plants are composited into crop and non dominant plant
    component. Crops are further separated into seed and stover. Plants
    are dried at 60 degrees C for a minimum of 48 hours and dry weights
    recorded along with the date of harvest, field replicate, treatment,
    sampling station and species code.
    </p>
    <p>In Treatment 5 (poplar plantation) biomass estimates are derived
    from measurements of basal diameter using an allometric relationship
    between diameter and biomass determined from a subset of trees
    harvested prior to leaf drop. In the DF (deciduous forest) and CF
    (conifer forest) wood annual growth is estimated by changes in stem
    diameter using an allometric equation available in Tritton and
    Hornbeck (1982). Leaf production in sites with trees is estimated with
    two 0.8 x 1.2 m litter traps placed on the forest floor of each site.

    <h3>Crop
    </h3>
    <p>plants are hand harvested using a 1 m <sup>2 </sup> quadrat (see
    Table 1) at each of the five sampling stations at physiological
    maturity of the crop:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Corn : black layer (early September).
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Soybeans : pre-leaf drop (early September).
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Wheat: kernel entering dough stage (mid-July).
    </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Plant tissue is dried and the total biomass of the plot is
    recorded. The tissue is then threshed (Almaco corn or small grain
    thresher) to separate the seed from stover. Seed biomass is recorded
    and moisture sub samples are taken using a Burrows Digital Moisture
    Computer 700. Seed and stover tissue sub samples are collected,
    combined by tissue type over stations, and archived for further
    analysis.

      <p>Samples are taken from each of the 5 sampling stations in each treatment replicate in
      the LTER main site (7 trts * 6 reps; in 1994 the forested sites were added to the sampling
      regime). The sampling location is 1 m to the southwest of the sampling flag; 10 cores (1
      inch diameter) to a depth of 15 cm are taken from a quadrat area of 25*25 cm. Cores are
      uniformly distributed in the quadrat.</p>
      <p>Each core is divided into 2 depth intervals: 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm. The 10 cores from each
      quadrat are composited and placed in separately labeled paper bags. Each bag is labeled
      with the trt/rep/sample location and depth. The 2 bags from each sample location are
      placed in a ziplock bag. Samples are stored in the dark at 5 degrees C until elutriated
      following methods in Gross and Renner (1989). Storing the samples at cool temperatures
      should prevent germination and facilitate elutriation as the samples will not form &quot;
      peds&quot; as a consequence of drying.</p>
    
    
    <p><em>Microplots:</em></p>
    
    
      <p>A single location is sampled from the center of each of the 4 microplots (+/-
      fertilizer; +/- herbicide) at 30&quot; row spacing in all reps of trts 1 and 2
      (conventional and notill). In the no fertilizer treatments, the samples are taken from the
      middle of the first 6 rows to avoid areas that were accidentally fertilized in 1989. All
      other samples are taken form the center of the 12 row microplot. </p>
    
    
    <p><em>Comments:</em></p>
    
    
      <p>Treatment 8 was not sampled. Treatment 1 (conventional till) will be resampled after it
      is plowed to determine how tillage effects the distribution and viability of seeds in the
      seed bank. If these samples are taken more than 2 weeks after the main site sampling was
      done, the no-till plots will be resampled f or a comparison of time effects. </p>

    <h2><a name="1">1 Overview</a></h2>
    
    <p>This document describes information management practices for the KBS LTER, with a special focus on the KBS Information Management System.  Currently, the primary tasks of the KBS LTER information manager include administration of the LTER server (shared with the LTER secretary), administration of the LTER web site (shared with the LTER secretary, special focus on data pages), administration of the KBS LTER Information Management System, and adminstration of the KBS LTER Weather Station.  Some guidance is given regarding network level collaborations in which KBS participates.

    <h2><a name="2">2  Business Continuity Plan </a></h2>
    
    <p>In the event of a major unforseen disruption of operations, steps may be taken subsequently to recover investment in data management.  Principally, this means recovery of critical data files.  KBS Computer Services provides a complete backup strategy for most KBS computers.  Backup tapes are stored offsite.  Request  files from KBS Computer Services, specifying the time of disruption if necessary.  The critical computer is LTERNT2, a member of GPRNET.  Critical drive is D:/.  Critical paths are D:/Databases/LTER/ and D:/Projects/LTER/.  The single most important file is D:/Databases/LTER/LTER_Metadata.mdb.

They serve the KBS LTER Internet Website and the KBS Internet Website, respectively (lter.kbs.msu.edu and www.kbs.msu.edu).  Both participate in GPRNET, a LAN.

    <p><em>Setting up the elutriator</em></p>
    
      <p>Turn on air until the needle reads across from the black 20. Turn
      on water to 70 psi.  Both these gauges should be checked regularly;
      during elutriation water should be at 30-40 psi.</p>
    
      <p><em>Processing samples</em></p>
    
      <p>Before pouring the soil into the chamber, break up all large
      clumps of soil and turn on the chamber to allow it to fill halfway
      with water. Add sample, making sure sieve system is in correct order
      of (from top to bottom) 710, 425, and 243 at the bottom. Elutriate
      0-5 cm samples for 10 minutes and 5-15 samples for 15 minutes. When
      the sample is done, remove all connecting chamber and sieve systems
      and rinse through into sieves to make sure nothing is left in the
      arm. As you take apart the system of sieves and connectors, rinse
      through each part into the next sieve down. Empty chamber and turn
      on, allowing it to rinse out for a few seconds.</p>
    
    <p><em>Filtering samples</em></p>
    
      <p>243 sieves should always be placed in the large funnels to be
      rinsed out. For 0-5 cm samples, the 425 and 710 sieves can be placed
      in smaller funnels unless the sample is unusually large. For 5-15 cm
      samples, the 425 is placed in a large funnel and the 710 is placed
      in a small funnel. It helps to wet the filter paper before placing
      the sieve in the funnel. Rinse off the outside of the sieve and
      rinse through screen, brushing lightly wit the tip of the water
      bottle to knock off material that is sticking. Use a spatula to
      remove all seeds that remain on the inside of the sieve after
      rinsing. The filter paper is easiest to remove from the funnel with
      the pump still on. If seeds have slipped down underneath the filter
      paper, rinse out of funnel onto filter paper. Place filter paper in
      appropriately labeled petri dish, not fully covering so that the
      filter paper will not dry and seeds will not germinate. When the
      filter paper is dry, cover the petri dish and tape securely for
      storage.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><em>Suggestions</em></p>
    
    
    
      <p>Label petri dishes and filter paper ahead of each sample. </p>
      <p>Use white grease to keep sieves and connectors from sticking
      together. Avoid getting grease in the mesh on the sieves because it
      will cause seeds to stick and water to back up. </p>
      <p>Make sure the chamber you are using has three functioning air jets. </p>
      <p>The pump should read at 200 or above on the red scale when it is
      functioning properly.  If this is not the case, there could be
      several causes:1) all connections with hoses should be tight; 2) the
      rubber stoppers should be pressed into the beakers as tightly as
      they can be; 3) the switch on the funnel should be in the vertical
      position when that funnel is on; 4) try to limit the number of
      funnels you have on at any one time; 5) make sure no water can get
      into the pump by emptying the beaker out frequently.</p>

    <li><p>Weigh 1 g (60 mesh- 250 m m) of soil in a 50 ml centrifuge tube
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Add 30 ml deionized water plus the anion exchange resin in the bicarbonate form (procedure to prepare resin
      bags attached).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Shake for 16 h, remove the resin bag and wash any soil that might adhere to the bag back into the tube,
    centrifuge the tube at 10 000 RPM for 10 min and discard the supernatant.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Extract the P from the resin bag, by shaking the resin bag with 20 ml of 0.5 N HCl for 24 hours.  Save in
    the cooler for determination of inorganic P in the resin extract.

    <kbsml_text><p>Sampling Frequency: minimum of once per month through the growing season (April -October)</p><p>The chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976) is used to estimate microbial biomass C and N.  Triplicate subsamples from the composite soil sample of each plot (30 g freshweight) are placed inside 50 ml glass beakers.  Two treatments, control and fumigated, are used.  Samples designated for fumigation are placed in a vacuum desiccator lined with moist paper towels.  Acid washed chloroform is placed in a 50 ml beaker in the center of the desiccator.  The desiccator is sealed, placed in a laboratory hood and evacuated, allowing the chloroform to boil for approximately 30 secs.  The boiling is repeated 4 times.  Samples are incubated for 24 h in the chloroform vapor-saturated atmosphere.  At the end of theincubation period the desiccator is vacuum air-flushed 8 times in order to remove the chloroform.  Samples are removed from the desiccator, placed in quart wide mouth canning jars and sealed with lids fitted with rubber septa for gas sampling.  At the same time, unfumigated soil samples are placed in canning jars and treated in the samefashion, serving as controls.  Evolved CO<sub>2</sub> is measured using a TCD gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column.  Biomass C, Bc, is derived from the relationship:</p><p>Bc = Fc/Kc</p><p>where Fc = [ (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from fumigated soil during the 10 day incubation) - (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from the control during the 10 d incubation)] and Kc = 0.41.</p><p>Biomass N is estimated by measuring the flush of 2 M KCl extractable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> at the end of the 10 d incubation period.  A 10 g subsample of the fumigated and unfumigated incubated samples is taken and analyzed for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>N.  Microbial biomass N, Bn, is derived using the equation:</p><p>Bn = Fn/Kn</p><p>where Fn = [( N mineralized by a fumigated soil for the 10 d incubation period) - (N mineralized by the unfumigated soil)] and Kn = [-0.14 (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from fumigated soil over the 10 day incubation period/N mineralized by the fumigated soil over the 10 day fumigation period) + 0.39].</p>

    <kbsml_text><h2>KBS LTER GPS Protocol</h2>
    
      <h2>Materials</h2>
    
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
    
      <p>The KBS LTER has two identical Trimble GPS units. "GPS I" is
      to be used exclusively by the KBS LTER staff. "GPS II" can be
      loaned to others with permission by the LTER Project Manager.</p>
    
      <p>Two components make up each GPS unit: the Trimble Data logger
      type TSCe with touch screen, and the Trimble Receiver Type Pro
      XRS model 33302-51.</p>
    
      <p>The GPS can be used in temperatures from -4 F to 140 F. The
      logger is designed to withstand accidental immersion so it should
      be fine to use it in the rain.</p>
    
      <p>The data logger is set to power off after 10 minutes of
      inactivity to conserve the batteries.</p>
    
      <p>Start, Settings, Control Panel, Power Off tab, &lt;On
      Batteries suspend after: 10 minutes&gt;</p>
    
      <h3>Software</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <li>TerraSync - Used for collecting and updating GPS data on
        the Trimble data logger.</li>
    
        <li>Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office (Version 2.9)- Used to manage
        and process GPS data on the PC.</li>
    
        <li>Microsoft Active Sync 3.1.0.9558 - Used to connect your PC
        to the Trimble Data Logger in order to transfer data.</li>
    
        <li>Omnistar is a GPS service that gives real-time
        differential correction. The Omnistar service will be
        maintained on "LTER GPS I", if funding allows. Omnistar service
        will not be purchased for LTER GPS II unless another user
        requests to borrow the unit and pays for the Omnistar service.
        See the Appendix for service details.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h2>Set Up</h2>
    
      <h3>GPS Mission Planning</h3>
    
      <p>GPS mission planning allows you to determine what time of day
      the satellites are in suboptimum position so that you can avoid
      collecting GPS data during these times. Mission planning is
      critical when collecting GPS data in forested areas or other
      challenging sites (see "Collecting Data in Trees or near
      Obstructions" in the Appendix).</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>The Planning Software should be installed on the two
        computer's in the Robertson Lab that have Trimble's GPS
        Pathfinder Office software, however, if it is not installed
        then do the following.

    <li>
    <p>All sample material must be dried and ground to a fine powder.  For soils, the dried soil could be ground
    using a roller bar shaker or ground on the EPA grinder in the greenhouse.  Plant tissue should be run first
    through the Wiley Mill and then passed through the Cyclotec grinder.  In addition, the micromill may be used to
    even further pulverize samples that are extremely small in quantity or contain large (&gt;2 mm) pieces of
    tissue following Cyclotech grinding.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Each CN run must begin with a tin foil blank cup (sample #1) and four acetanilide standards (samples 2 thru
    5).  The 1st standard should weigh about 0.2 to 0.3 mg, the 2nd standard should weigh about 0.5 to 0.6 mg, the
    3rd standard should weigh about 1.0 to 1.2 mg, and the 4th standard should weigh about 2.0 to 2.8 mg.  Sample
    #6 should be a blind standard of either soil or plant, depending on the type of samples on the run.  It is
    important to check the printout value of this sample to ensure that the standard curve was properly set.  If
    the values for C &amp; N are off for this blind standard, the run should be stopped.  We are attempting to
    initiate a new standard using the NIST tissue of citrus leaves or tomato leaves, however, the N content is not
    certified and the carbon value is not available from NIST.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is recommended to run blind standards (the "soil standard" or an NIST compound) a minimum of every 15
    samples to ensure confidence in the analysis.  The soil standards are O519 and O559 (provided by USDA-ARS
    Pendleton OR) or an LTER-recommended soil NIST standard.  The plant standard compounds include citrus leaves,
    pine needles and tomato leaves.

    <h2>To Weigh a Sample or Standard
    </h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>Turn on the Sartorius scale if the display is not lit., press tare to bring display to 0.00 mg.  It is
    recommended that you wear gloves while weighing samples.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Place an empty tin foil cup on the weighing tray and close the doors.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Tare off the weight of the cup using the tare button.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Remove the cup and fill with ~ 1 spoon of tissue.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Crunch the cup using two sets of tweezers.  Once completely closed into a ball formation, drop onto the
    weighing plate to ensure no sample leaks out.  If the sample is leaky, discard the ball and begin again.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Place the closed cup onto the weighing pan and record the weight (in mg) on the provided datasheet.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Gently remove the sample and place into the plexiglass sample holding trays.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Bring the scale display back to 0.00 mg by pressing tare.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Using KIM wipes, clean the tweezers, the spoon, and the metal plate between each sample.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The key to the samples is a consistent weight .  Soil samples should weigh between 10.0 to 15.0 mg, and
    plant samples from 4 to 6 mg.  The Sartorius scale can't provide an accurate weight under 0.2 mg.  Plexiglass
    plates should be stored in a vacuum desiccator until analyzed.

    <h3>Protocol for N application in forest and successional field plots</h3>
            
    <p>Fertilized (F) plots are 100 m<sup>2</sup> (10m x 10m) each, except in 3 CF, where the fertilized plot is 6m<sup>2</sup>(2m x 3m). Annual application rate is 10 kg N as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to 100 g (6 g on 3 CF) N per plot. The N is added in 5 doses. 4.5 L (0.3 L on 3 CF) per plot each time. This is equivalent to 0.05 mm precipitation. The 5 doses are applied in the period April thru November (after spring thaw thru litterfall).</p>
            <p>Three-fold fertilization (3F) plots are 4m<sup>2</sup>(2m x 2m) each. The annual application rate is 30 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>added in 0.5 L per plot increments. This is equal to 0.13 mm precipitation.</p>
            <p>Preparing the N solution.</p>
    <p>Dissolve 190 g of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>(35% N) in 15 L "Nano-pure" water in each of three "handy cans".</p>
            <p>Spaying the plots</p>
    <p>This can be done either by amount or by time. To do it by time, calibrate the backpack sprayer according to the ace of the person handling it. Spray a at a constant (maximum) rate for 30 seconds into a 1 L jar and weigh the amount . Repeat 3 to 4 times. Calculate spray rate per minute. Per Ambus averaged (450 to 480 ml per min).</p>
            <p>In the field transfer 5 L of N solution into the sprayer. Begin spraying the 3F plot to add 0.5 L (about 1 min 15 sec). The F plots are divided into quadrants. The three first quadrants are sprayed to add 1.13 L ( about 2 min 30 sec) the remaining solution is distributed in the fourth quadrant. When the sprayer is getting low the rate decreases markedly. The 2 x 3 m F plot in 3 CF is sprayed to add 0.3 L (approximately 40 sec).</p>
            <p>6-9-1997 Calibration for the sprayer was 550 - 650 ml in 30 seconds. There were 3 additional applications in 1997 (sb. is that in addition to the planned 5 or instead of?)</p></kbsml_text>

    <h2>Overview
    </h2>
    <p>Microbial transformations of organic N to ammonium is designated
    ammonification; while the bacterial conversion of ammonium to nitrite
    and nitrate is called nitrification.  The sum of these processes is N-
    mineralization.  N-mineralization and nitrification are measured by
    estimated changes in accumulated and in situ nitrogen pool sizes, the
    difference equalling the assumed net mineralization potential.  Two
    methods of estimatimg N-mineralization and nitrification are used: a
    short-term buried bag (in field) incubation that accounts for the
    daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and a long-term incubation
    that assesses soil organic matter quality with respect to
    mineralizable N.
    </p>
    <p>Soils collected for short-term N mineralization
    experiments(incubated in field) are seived, composited and then
    divided into threesubsamples.  The first subsample (designated T0) is
    analysed immediately for moisture and inorganic NH4+ and NO3-.  The
    other two bags are incubated in the field for 21 days (T21) and
    designated A and B.  This is done for all plots.  The bags are
    incubated in their respective plots.  These bags are then collected
    after an in field incubation of 21 days.  The soil samples in both bag
    A and bag B of each plot are composited and analyzed for moisture
    andinorganic NH4+ and NO3-.

  description: "<kbsml_text>\r\n\
    <h2>Sample Collection and Processing</h2>\r\n\
    <p> The LTER Biodiversity plots are 9.1 x 27.4 m (30 x 90 feet).  Soil\r\n\
    cores are collected at each of two sampling stations along a transect\r\n\
    that is centered between the east and west sides the plot.  One\r\n\
    sampling station is 9 meters from the south border of the plot on the\r\n\
    west side of the transect, the second station is 18 meters from the\r\n\
    south border of the plot on the east side of the transect.  The cores\r\n\
    are taken in at area of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 meters.  Half of the\r\n\
    cores are taken within the crop row and half are taken between the\r\n\
    rows.  Distances to sampling stations are estimated by pacing. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    A total of six 0-25 cm cores (three at each station) are collected and\r\n\
    composited.  A second set cores, from 0-10 cm in depth, are collected\r\n\
    at the two sampling stations, two cores at each station, and\r\n\
    composited.  Before sampling each plot, a core is taken at the edge of\r\n\
    the plot and discarded to prevent carryover between plots.  Latex\r\n\
    gloves are worn when collecting soil cores in the field and while\r\n\
    sieving.  Soil samples are sieved using a 4 mm mesh sieve. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    Soil samples are refrigerated at 4C until processing is complete.\r\n\
    Ideally, samples for inorganic nitrogen and soil moisture should be\r\n\
    processed within 24 hours of collection.  The maximum time between\r\n\
    collection and processing is 48 hours.  Archive samples to be used for\r\n\
    microbial (e.g. Phospholipid Fatty Acids) or DNA analysis should be\r\n\
    frozen at -80C within 48 hours of collection. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    The 0-25 cm soil sample is analyzed for inorganic nitrogen (NO3 and\r\n\
    NH4 pools) and soil moisture.  The remainder of the sample is air\r\n\
    dried and archived.  The 0-10 cm soil cores are archived.  Four\r\n\
    whirlpaks containing 25-30 g each are frozen at -80C and the remainder\r\n\
    is air dried and archived.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>Inorganic Nitrogen</h2>\r\n\
    <p> Weigh 10 \xC2\xB10.01 g of sieved soil into a\r\n\
    urinalysis cup (u-cup).  Add 100 ml of 1 M KCl, shake for one minute\r\n\
    and allow to stand overnight.  Shake again for one minute the next day\r\n\
    and let stand for about one hour or until the supernatant partially\r\n\
    clears.  Filter the supernatant with a syringe filter using a type A/E\r\n\
    1 \xC2\xB5m pore size glass fiber filter.  Refrigerate filtered supernatant\r\n\
    if analysis will be done within one week, otherwise freeze extract at\r\n\
    -10C to hold for analysis.  Analysis for inorganic nitrogen is\r\n\
    performed on an Alpkem segmented flow analyzer.\r\n\
    </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Moisture</h2>\r\n\
    <p> All weights for soil moisture are measured to\r\n\
    nearest 0.01 g.  Label a soil tin with sample ID.  Record weight of\r\n\
    \"Tin, Lid, and Label\".  Place 20-25 g of sieved, field moist\r\n\
    soil in the tin.  Weigh and record the weight of the fresh soil.  Dry\r\n\
    open tins in an oven at 105C for at least 24 hours.  Remove from the\r\n\
    oven and place lid on tin.  When cooled to room temperature, record\r\n\
    weight of \"Tin, Lid, Label, and Dry Soil\".  The weight of the\r\n\
    dry soil is calculated by subtracting the \"Tin, Lid, and Label\"\r\n\
    weight from the \"Tin, Lid, Label, and Dry Soil\" weight.  Soil\r\n\
    moisture is expressed on a % dry weight basis by the formula: % Soil\r\n\
    Moisture = 100 * [(Fresh weight - dry weight)/dry weight]\r\n\

    <p>Conversion of Longitude and Latitude to UTM Coordinates</p>
    <p>Created 2/21/01, Tim Bergsma</p>
    <p>The GPS unit on the harvester generates spatial data as decimal longitude (x
    coordinate) and latitude (y coordinate, with altitude in feet (above mean sea level?).  The desired
    coordinate system is a UTM projection, using NAD83 or WGS84 zone 16 as a
    reference (I assume they are identical for our purposes), with height in meters.</p>
    <p>One way to make the conversion to UTM is to use ArcView 3.2.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Start ArcView 3.2.</p>
    </li><li><p>Turn on the projector extension:  </p>
    <p>
    <em>
    File&gt;Extensions&gt;Projector!</em></p>
    </li><li><p>Open a new project (if necessary) and save as <em> temp.apr</em>.</p>
    </li><li><p>(optional)  For convenience, set default working directory:  e.g. </p>
    <p>
    <em>
    Project&gt;Properties&gt;Working Directory</em>&gt;g:\inetpub\lter\yield_data\2000_soybean.</p>
    </li><li><p>Bring <em> temp.txt</em> into the project:  </p>
    <p> <em> Project&gt;Add Table&gt;List
    Files of Type&gt; *.txt</em>;<em> temp.txt.</em></p>
    </li><li><p>Create a 'view':  e.g. select the view button and click 'new'
    in the project window.  Creates 'View1 by default.</p>
    </li><li><p>With the view active, you should get a view menu in the tool
    bar.  Choose </p>
    <p> <em> View&gt;Add Event Theme </em></p>
    <p> and then set the table and coordinate
    columns as necessary (e.g. <em> temp.txt</em>, longitude, latitude).</p>
    </li><li><p>Choose </p>
    <p> <em> View&gt;Properties&gt;Map Units&gt;decimal degrees.  </em></p>
    <p>
    This tells arcview how to interpret your long/lat data.</p>
    </li><li><p>Choose </p>
    <p> <em> View&gt;Properties&gt;Projection&gt;Category&gt;UTM 1983 </em></p>
    <p> and </p>
    <p><em>&gt;Type&gt;zone 16.  </em></p>
    <p> This creates a projection of your long/lat data into
    meters.</p>
    </li><li><p>With the theme active (click near the theme name in the view
    window), choose </p>
    <p> <em> Theme&gt;Convert to Shapefile&gt;File Name&gt;</em><em>temp.shp </em></p>
    <p> and </p>
    <p><em>&gt;Directory&gt; </em> (set appropriately).</p>
    </li><li><p><em>'Do you want to save in the projected units?'</em>  yes. <em>
    'Shapefile
    not added to view.' </em> o.k.</p>
    </li><li><p>Now you have one view coded in long/lat.  You have a shapefile
    on disk coded in UTM.  Create a new view ('View2' by default)  into which to put the shape
    file:  click the <em>View</em> button and then the <em>New</em> button.</p>
    </li><li><p>Choose </p>
    <p> <em> View&gt;Add Theme&gt;</em><em> temp.shp.</em></p>
    </li><li><p>(optional)  Choose </p>

Macroinvertebrates will be collected with a 7.6 cm diameter soil corerdriven gently by hand to a depth of 20 cm.  One core is taken at each of the 5 soil sampling stations per plot and all 5 cores are composited as one soil sample.  Soil samples are removed from the coring device, placed in zip-lock bags and stored in coolers.  Samples are then returned to the laboratory and stored at 40 &#176;C.  Macroinvertebrates are recovered from soil cores within 48 h of collection by elutriation.  The soil-root washer (Gilson Hydropneumatic Elutriator) is utilized to suspend soil subsamples in a vortex of water and compressed air which floats off soil and suspended organics.  Eluent from the elutriator is passed over a series of sieves which retains material greater than 300 m.  This retained material is preserved in 90% ethanol.  Invertebrates are then hand-sorted from the collected debris under a dissecting scope (25x), preserved in 75% ethanol and identified to the lowest practical taxon.</p></kbsml_text>"

    <p>All bacteria are non-selectively stained green by this procedure.
    Observe the bacteria using a fluorescence microscope with a 63 x
    oil-immersion objective and 1.6 x zoom factor.  Excitation filter
    450-490 nm, dichroic 510 nm and suppression &lt; 515 nm.  Collect 3
    images from each smear (3 x 5 = 15 images per sample) (Princeton
    Instruments cooled CCD camera with 512 x 768 pixels each representing
    0.089 x 0.089 &#181;m at this magnification).  Measured soil bacteria
    average 0.9 x 0.4 &#181;m, which corresponds to about 10 x 5 pixels.
    The software procedure is set to discard any objects represented by
    fewer than 5 pixels (smaller than about 0.2 x 0.2 &#181;m).  The
    bacteria are detected, counted and measured by image analysis (IPLab
    Spectrum Software, Apple Macintosh PPC computer).
    </p>
    <p>The volume (
    <em>bv
    </em>) of each bacteria is calculated from measurements of the large,
    <em> l
    </em> , and small,
    <em>d
    </em> , diameters of each cell by assuming that the cells are prolate spheroids.

    <li>
    <p>Digging</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>Lay the tarp or plywood next to where you will be digging.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Set the auger at an angle above 45&#176; , e.g. 60&#176; or so. Start turning.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Take the soil you are removing and carefully place it on the tarp or plywood, keeping the horizons separate.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Dig until you are 5-10 cm into the C horizon. You should be able to tell by the texture. The soil will become almost pure sand, right after the clayey B horizon.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Remove auger and place pipe down into hole, centering it.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Pound pipe until it has deepened the hole by 15 to 20 cm or so.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Remove pipe carefully, retaining the soil in its core. Note that the hole should be smaller in
    diameter than that made by the auger.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Bang pipe or use stick to clear out soil.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Arrange pipe so that it is sticking in the hole again.

    <p>Attach a deterioration-resistant string securely to the lysimeter, for retrieval
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Unscrew the nut on the lysimeter, taking care not to lose the ferrules.
     Push tubing through back piece (tubing longer than that supplied will likely
     be necessary). This may takeconsiderable effort:  twisting with pliers may help.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Cut the end of the tubing off at an angle. This is important because
    otherwise the tubing can suction itself against the wall of the lysimeter, which
    blocks passage of water. (It also removes any tubing damaged with pliers.)
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Screw the nut back onto the lysimeter, making sure that the ferrules are in
    place and that the tubing sticks out into the lumen of the lysimeter, but is
    not pressed all the way into the tip.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Then take some deionized water into the syringe and attach syringe to tubing on opposite end of lysimeter.

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Squeeze the water into the lysimeter to force all the air out. Squeeze water

    <h2>Introduction
    </h2>
    
    <p>A key aspect of establishing a long term program in insect
    spatial and temporal dynamics is the development of a sampling
    protocol. This includes the use of a standard method of
    measurement for the species assemblage being monitored and the
    use of permanent sample site locations distributed throughout the
    landscape at known geographic locations. The application of
    permanent sampling sites was used to account for differences in
    time (weeks, years) without the complication of spatial
    variation. A new sampling protocol was developed for the insect
    monitoring within the KBS-LTER. Several factors were considered
    when developing the method used to sample the selected insect
    groups: a) a method which could be used in different habitats; b)
    simple to maintain the sample device; c) low cost; d) ease of
    removal of the sample device due to agronomic practices, e)
    ability to sample a large number of locations over a sizeable
    geographic area, and, f) independent of the observer. Six years
    of consistent data have been collected weekly from May-August
    from 210 permanent sample locations from the main LTER site.
    Presently, 285 stations are sampled weekly over a 12-14 week
    period each year.</p>
    
    <p>To satisfy these constraints, a colored (yellow) sticky trap
    is used to sample plant dwelling predators (coccinellids,
    chrysopids, lampyrids). The pitfall trap is used to sample ground
    dwelling predators (carabids, arachnids, staphylinids). The
    pitfall trap is a common method to record ground dwelling
    invertebrate predators. The use of the sticky trap is less
    commonly used. The consistency of patterns of catch of plant
    dwelling predators during the six-year study has indicated that
    sticky traps have the same advantages and disadvantages of the
    pitfall trap. The use of the selected trapping methods has
    provided the possibility to conduct the study at larger scales
    with more groups of invertebrates (other than ground dwelling
    arthropods), which has enhanced the understanding of the way that
    invertebrates interact with the landscape.</p>
    
    
    </div>
    <div><h2>Plant dwelling insect predators
    </h2>
    
    <p>At each sampling station we place one insect trap. Each trap
    consists of a double sided cardboard yellow sticky trap (unbaited
    Pherocon, Zoecon, Palo Alto, CA) suspended 1.2 m above the ground
    as described in the next figure.</p>
    
    <p>Insect adults are sampled weekly during the growing season
    (approximately from early May to late August). Insect are
    identified in the field (using a pictorial key), recorded on
    sampling sheets, and removed from the traps. Yellow sticky traps
    are replaced every two weeks. All the data and ancillary
    information are entered into a computer using a statistical
    spreadsheet for maintenance and analysis.</p>
    
    <p>In 1995, we initiated the use of a Newton 110 PDA (personal
    digital assistant) to substitute for sampling sheets in the
    field. A special set of sampling software, designed initially for
    plant dwelling insect sampling needs, but with potential for
    other sampling protocols, allowed direct capture of all plant
    dwelling insect directly on the field. At the end of each day
    data are downloaded directly into a relational database system
    for subsequent data management and analysis. </p>

Bases of the chambers (28 cm x 28 cm x 10 cm high) are permanently installed in all plots of 4 replicate blocks (removed only for farming activities).  Chamber bases are constructed from aluminum sheeting with a channel on the top outside rim to fit a plexiglass cover (29 cm x 29 cm x 14 cm high) fitted with a rubber septa.

Another 10 mL gas sample is taken from the trap and placed in the glass vial, giving the vial a gas overpressure of 7 mL.  CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O are determined by gas chromatography.  CH<sub>4</sub>is analyzed with aflame ionization detector (300 degrees C), while N<sub>2</sub>O is analyzed with a 63Ni electron capture detector (350 degrees C).

    </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Preparation:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Place metal frames in ground, bottom edge approximately 1in below surface.  The frames must be level to
    hold  water in and maintain a proper air-tight seal at sampling.  (On badly sloping sites, this can be achieved
     by  carefully hammering a wooden 2 x 4 placed over the top [the channel is on the top] of the base; use a
    level  to  check anle).  Frames should be set into ground at least 1 day before sampling; they remain in the
    soil  until  winter, and are not removed between sampling times except for plowing treatments.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Plant growth within the box frames needs to be clipped without disturbing the soil prior to sampling
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Vials need to be crimped prior to sampling date.  Number of boxes * 4sampling times(T0-T3) = number of
    vials  needed.  All vials are numbered with the set ID, then vials #'s 1-210 (for a full campaign, excluding
    fertilizer sites; 1-136 for treatments 1-8 only), for gas sample identification.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>It is a good idea to check the boxes (frames and lids) for plant growth and damage, and to level the frames
     the  day before sampling.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>The box lids need maintenance work on occasion.  The epoxyseals lining the edges of the box lid should be
    checked by filling the boxes with water - look for leaks.  We've also been sealing the bottom channel on the
    gas box frames to prevent leaking.
    </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Sampling:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Record T0 soil temperature on data sheet.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Record gas box lid type- it will be marked on the top (A,B, or C)
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Check the frames for obvious cracks.  Fill the frame troughs with water without spilling water onto the
    soil  (added water may stimulate biological activity).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Check septa (venoject) on the box lids and replace if needed; they get dirty and gooey as they weather.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Place PVC lid on frame and check to see if a proper seal has formed; if lid has been laying flat on the
    ground,  make sure you're not just moving the air that's been trapped inside for weeks directly onto the frame.
      Gently  pull lid up and feel for suction or check water level
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Flush the sample vial with air from the chamber using a vent neele.  Remove the vent needle and inject
    sample.   We usually flush with 10ml and inject as much as of an additional 10ml as possible (The over pressure
     gaurds  against sample contamination, and provides an easy means for removing known volumes from the vial
    during gas  analysis).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Start timer as the first sample is injected into the vial; record vial number and time on data sheet.
    </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Helpful hints: It is easiest to keep track of where you are in the vial sequence by placing the vent needle
    in the next vial to be used and turning the &quot;used&quot; vials upside down in the tray.  Some of the
    septa/vials may leak - this shouls be fairly obvious, listen for the leak.  If rain is expected, data sheets
    can be photocopied onto rainproof paper.
    </p>
    <p>In the lab, analyze vials for CH4 (using the GC-FID), N2O (GC-FID), and CO2 (IRGA).  Analyze prior N2O,
    because  the ECD carrier gas contains 10% CH4- you will contaminate CH4 samples with carryover from the ECD
    injection  port.  Samples should be analyzed within a

    <p>Precipitation is measured using a Belfort Weighing Bucket Preciptiation Gauge.  Staff checks the gauge weekly, changing the chart and emptying the bucket as necessary.  During the winter, antifreeze (ethylene glycol solution) is added to the bucket, which serves to melt snow and protect the bucket.  The paper chart is changed weekly, and read by staff in units of 1/20th of one inch. Database algorythms convert readings to mm.  A date is midnight to midnight local time, either Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time.  During the visit to the station, other sensors are inspected.

    LTER Weather Station Maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
    6-10-2002.  Tim Bergsma.  A maintenance routine for the LTER weather station has become institutionalized, but has not been thoroughly documented.  In 1997 a weighing bucket rain gauge was installed at the station, eventually replacing the tipping bucket rain gauge.  The design of the new gauge requires weekly maintenance visits; some method loosely corresponding to the protocol below has been employed since then.  Details vary.  For instance, copies of the removed charts were made and stored, from 7-29-97 until 10-15-2001.  I am no longer maintaining copies.  No regular log has been kept:  I am institutionalizing the log today.  Details of the operation of the weather station since its initial deployment exist in a variety of forms, and should be available elsewhere.  My purpose here is to create a protocol for weather station maintenance that corresponds to current practice.  Those maintaining the station should document whether this or some other protocol was employed, noting significant deviations, if any.

    <ol>
    <li><p>Label a new chart with station, date, expected time of deployment (optional) and your initials.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fold the labeled tab under, and mount on spare drum.  Tail of chart overlaps clip such that pen won't snag if it passes the clip.</p></li>
    <li><p>Proceed to weather station.  Visually inspect tower, sensors.</p></li>
    <li><p>Climb tower to examine two light sensors at 3m.  Wipe sensing surfaces with a soft cloth if necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Inspect rain gauge and open the access door.</p></li>
    <li><p>"Ship" the pen and remove the current drum (becomes the spare).</p></li>
    <li><p>Write in pencil directly on the removed chart:  OFF [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].</p></li>
    <li><p>Store the chart/drum for transport. </p></li>
    <li><p>Wind the clock fully (but gently), about 24 strokes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Label the new chart, ON, [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].</p></li>
    <li><p>Place the new drum, seated fully.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add ink to the pen as necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Remove the collection cylinder if necessary for the following.</p></li>
    <li><p>Install or remove the collection funnel as necessary.  Should not be in place if there is risk of snow.</p></li>
    <li><p>Empty bucket if necessary.  Rain water can be dumped locally.  If antifreeze is present, dispose properly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add/remove antifreeze as necessary.  Add if collected precip. is at risk of freezing, remove when diluted to ineffectiveness by precipitation.</p></li>
    <li><p>Replace bucket and collection cylinder as necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place pen against chart, while setting the time.  Set the time by rotating the drum counter-clockwise only (avoids hysteresis error).</p></li>
    <li><p>Start the ink flowing by prodding with a pointed object, if necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Close the access door.</p></li>
    <li><p>Ensure that plants are not growing in the bare soil reserve (east half of fenced area).  Spray with Roundup if necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Ensure that plants are not excessively tall in the vegetated soil reserve (west half of fenced area).  Clip if necessary, to maintain canopy between 10 and 20 cm.</p></li>

    <h3>Preparation
    </h3>
    
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p> Place chamber base in ground, bottom edge approximately 1 inch below surface.  The frames must be level.  On badly sloping sites, this can be achieved by carefully hammering a wooden 2 x 4 placed over the top of the base; use a level to check angle.  Frames should be set into ground at least 1 day before sampling; they remain in the soil until winter, and are not removed between sampling times except for plowing treatments. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Plant growth within the box frames needs to be clipped to base height (do not clip to soil surface) without disturbing the soil prior to sampling.  Litter is left in place.  The area inside the frame should be as representative as possible to the area outside the frame. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Vials need to be crimped prior to sampling date.  Number of boxes *4 sampling times (T0 - T3) = number of vials needed.  all vials are numbered with the set ID, then vial #'s 1 - 210 (for a full campaign, excluding fertilizer sites; 1 - 136 for treatments 1 - 8 only), for gas sample identification. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> It is a good idea to check the boxes (frames and lids) for plant growth and damage, and to level the frames and clean the lids the day before sampling. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> The chamber lids need to be kept clean; clean the inside with water (only) before each use.  The epoxy seals lining the edges of the box lid should be checked by filling the boxes with water - look for leaks.  We've also been sealing the bottom channel on the gas box frames to prevent leaking. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Frame height measured. 
    </p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Sampling
    </h3>
    
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p> Stay on trails - do not trample plants or compress soil near chamber. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Record T0 soil temperature on data sheet; temperature probe should be inserted 10 cm. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Record gas box lid type - it will be marked on the top (A, B, or C).  Record height at 4 places. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Check the frames for obvious cracks.  Fill the frame troughs with water (square chambers) without spilling water onto the soil (added water may stimulate biological activity). 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p> Check septa on the box lids and replace if needed; they get dirty and gooey as they weather.

    LTER Weather Station Maintenance

    6-10-2002.  Tim Bergsma.  A maintenance routine for the LTER weather station has become institutionalized, but has not been thoroughly documented.  In 1997 a weighing bucket rain gauge was installed at the station, eventually replacing the tipping bucket rain gauge.  The design of the new gauge requires weekly maintenance visits; some method loosely corresponding to the protocol below has been employed since then.  Details vary.  For instance, copies of the removed charts were made and stored, from 7-29-97 until 10-15-2001.  I am no longer maintaining copies.  No regular log has been kept:  I am institutionalizing the log today.  Details of the operation of the weather station since its initial deployment exist in a variety of forms, and should be available elsewhere.  My purpose here is to create a protocol for weather station maintenance that corresponds to current practice.  Those maintaining the station should document whether this or some other protocol was employed, noting significant deviations, if any.

    <p>Soil cores are taken at 5 sampling stations per plot. Soil cores (2.5
    cm dia.) are taken north of each station flag to a depth of 25 cm. An
    equal number of cores are taken within row and between row when row
    crops are grown. In non-cropped systems, cores are taken at 10 cm
    intervals. All cores from each plot are composited in one sampling
    bag. A standard sampling consists of 2 cores at each station.  Some
    samplings will have more cores when soil demand is high. Normally
    samplers start at the south end of Rep 1, 2, 3, and 4. They work north
    and finish on the north side of Rep 5. Rep 6 and treatment 8&#146;s
    are sampled after finishing with rep 5. 5. Forested sites are
    collected by one person at the same time the main site is being
    sampled. If 5 people are not available the forested sites maybe
    sampled in the afternoon while soil from the main site is being
    sieved.</p>
    
    <p>The soil is brought to the lab and sieved through a 4 mm screen to
    remove debris and to homogenize the soil sample. Each treatment has a
    specific screen in order to reduce contamination between
    treatments. Latex gloves are worn when sieving and mixing the
    soil.</p>
    
    <p>Field moist sieved soil subsamples are distributed to individuals
    requesting soil prior to sampling. Excess soil is air dried and stored
    by date of sampling. All samples, except the April sample, are
    disposed of at the end of the year. The April sample is archived for
    CN analysis.</p>
    
    <p>Mineralization potential may be assessed by as the difference in
    nitrate and ammonia values from the initial sampling and an
    &quot;incubated&quot; sample. Incubations are perfomed on a subsample
    of the initial composite sample which is placed into a gas-permeable
    plastic bag and buried in the plot from which the soil
    originated. Incubation length is 21 days. (see Short-term
    mineralization file for details).</p>

    </ol>
    
    
    <p><em>Procedure</em></p>
    
      <p>1. Label plastic bags with appropriate information about the
      sample (e.g. project, date, plot, variate. Cover labels with clear
      mailing tape to secure label to bag and to protect against
      moisture.</p>
      <p>2. Prepare sampling buckets. Each bucket should have the
      following: site map, sharpie marker, butter knife, sampling bags,
      and soil probe.</p>
      <p>3. Take samples to 25 cm at each of the 5 sampling stations. A
      butter knife is helpful in removing soil from the probe. In cropped
      systems, an equal number of cores should be taken in the crop row
      and between the crop row. Take the same number of cores from
      non-cropped systems. Composite all samples for each plot in one
      plastic bag.</p>
      <p>4. Tie the sample bag and place in the alleyway to be picked up
      when the sampling is completed. All efforts should be made to
      complete sampling in all plots on the same day.</p>
      <p>5. Take a core at the edge of the next plot to clean the soil
      probe. This will reduce contamination between plots.</p>
      <p>6. Pick up soil samples and return to dry lab.</p>
      <p>7. Separate soils by treatment.</p>
      <p>8. Wear latex gloves while sieving. Sieve each soil sample using
      the 4 mm mesh soil sieve labeled for that treatment. Sieves are kept
      in the dry lab.</p>
      <p>9. Sieve soil into a plastic tote tray. Return sieved soil to the
      plastic sample bag. Discard rocks and large organic matter remaining
      on the screen.</p>
      <p>10. Brush sieve and tote tray clean.</p>
      <p>11. Change latex gloves after each treatment.</p>
    
    <p>12. Weigh plastic bags containing sieved soil and record weights in
    lab book.</p> <p>13. Place soil samples into 4 degrees C

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in soil solution. This
    measure is generally considered an index of the acid or base intensity of a soil. The pH
    reading is a product of complex electrode behavior with the soil suspension and
    differences in soil:solution ratio, electrolyte concentration of the soil suspension, and
    spatial placement of the electrode can affect this reading (Mclean 1982). Soil acidity has
    a direct effect on the plant and is a major factor affecting nutrient availability to
    plants.</p>

    <p>Field moist soil is weighed to 15g (14.98 to 15.02 g) into 2 replicate
    extraction cups. Cups are capped after weighing to avoid moisture loss. Using a repipet or
    graduated cylinder 30 ml deionized water is added to each cup, capped and shaken for a
    few seconds. The cap is removed to allow the solution to equilibrate with the atmosphere
    for at least 30 minutes. The pH meter is standardized at pH 7 and 4.</p>
    
    <p>While gently swirling the slurry the electrode is placed into the
    slurry. pH is measured to the nearest 0.01. Between samples the electrode is rinsed with
    deionized water.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Soil moisture content affects microbial activity, nutrient
    movement, and plant growth. Soil moisture content is needed to
    calculate other soil biological parameters (e.g. N mineralization) on
    a common (dry weight of soil) basis. The gravimetric method calculates
    soil moisture by the difference between the fresh weight and dry
    weight of a given soil sample.</p>
    
    
    </div><div><h2>General Procedure</h2>
    
    
    <p>Soil moisture samples are taken from the sieved soil samples at the
    same time nitrogen mineralization samples are being weighed.  This
    reduces the amount of time spent on handling the soil samples and
    provides moisture availability for mineralization calculations.</p>

    <p>Campbell Scientifc sensors are connected to a CR10x datalogger, which takes readings every 10 seconds and stores hourly integrated values.  Temperature is measured by a model 107 temperature probe, housed in a vented shield.  Wind speed is measured by a model 014A, wind direction by model 024A.  The HMP35C RH meter was replaced in October 2001 with HMP45C.  The quantum sensor is model LI190S.  The pyranometer is LI200S.  See field logs for calibration dates, etc.
