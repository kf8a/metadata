  body: "<h3>Sample Collection and Processing</h3>\r\n\
    <p> The LTER Biodiversity plots are 9.1 x 27.4 m (30 x 90 feet).  Soil\r\n\
    cores are collected at each of two sampling stations along a transect\r\n\
    that is centered between the east and west sides the plot.  One\r\n\
    sampling station is 9 meters from the south border of the plot on the\r\n\
    west side of the transect, the second station is 18 meters from the\r\n\
    south border of the plot on the east side of the transect.  The cores\r\n\
    are taken in at area of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 meters.  Half of the\r\n\
    cores are taken within the crop row and half are taken between the\r\n\
    rows.  Distances to sampling stations are estimated by pacing. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    A total of six 0-25 cm cores (three at each station) are collected and\r\n\
    composited.  A second set cores, from 0-10 cm in depth, are collected\r\n\
    at the two sampling stations, two cores at each station, and\r\n\
    composited.  Before sampling each plot, a core is taken at the edge of\r\n\
    the plot and discarded to prevent carryover between plots.  Latex\r\n\
    gloves are worn when collecting soil cores in the field and while\r\n\
    sieving.  Soil samples are sieved using a 4 mm mesh sieve. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    Soil samples are refrigerated at 4C until processing is complete.\r\n\
    Ideally, samples for inorganic nitrogen and soil moisture should be\r\n\
    processed within 24 hours of collection.  The maximum time between\r\n\
    collection and processing is 48 hours.  Archive samples to be used for\r\n\
    microbial (e.g. Phospholipid Fatty Acids) or DNA analysis should be\r\n\
    frozen at -80C within 48 hours of collection. </p>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    The 0-25 cm soil sample is analyzed for inorganic nitrogen (NO3 and\r\n\
    NH4 pools) and soil moisture.  The remainder of the sample is air\r\n\
    dried and archived.  The 0-10 cm soil cores are archived.  Four\r\n\
    whirlpaks containing 25-30 g each are frozen at -80C and the remainder\r\n\
    is air dried and archived.</p>\r\n\

    </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <h3>Inorganic Nitrogen</h3>\r\n\
    <p> Weigh 10 \xC2\xB10.01 g of sieved soil into a\r\n\
    urinalysis cup (u-cup).  Add 100 ml of 1 M KCl, shake for one minute\r\n\
    and allow to stand overnight.  Shake again for one minute the next day\r\n\
    and let stand for about one hour or until the supernatant partially\r\n\
    clears.  Filter the supernatant with a syringe filter using a type A/E\r\n\
    1 \xC2\xB5m pore size glass fiber filter.  Refrigerate filtered supernatant\r\n\
    if analysis will be done within one week, otherwise freeze extract at\r\n\
    -10C to hold for analysis.  Analysis for inorganic nitrogen is\r\n\
    performed on an Alpkem segmented flow analyzer.\r\n\
    </p>\r\n\
    <h3>Moisture</h3>\r\n\
    <p> All weights for soil moisture are measured to\r\n\
    nearest 0.01 g.  Label a soil tin with sample ID.  Record weight of\r\n\
    \"Tin, Lid, and Label\".  Place 20-25 g of sieved, field moist\r\n\
    soil in the tin.  Weigh and record the weight of the fresh soil.  Dry\r\n\
    open tins in an oven at 105C for at least 24 hours.  Remove from the\r\n\
    oven and place lid on tin.  When cooled to room temperature, record\r\n\
    weight of \"Tin, Lid, Label, and Dry Soil\".  The weight of the\r\n\
    dry soil is calculated by subtracting the \"Tin, Lid, and Label\"\r\n\
    weight from the \"Tin, Lid, Label, and Dry Soil\" weight.  Soil\r\n\
    moisture is expressed on a % dry weight basis by the formula: % Soil\r\n\
    Moisture = 100 * [(Fresh weight - dry weight)/dry weight]\r\n\

    Sampling Frequency: Weekly and/or Precipitation-Event Basis
    
    CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes are estimated using in situ closed-cover flux chambers. Buckets are permanently installed in all plots in triplicate for the N-Fertilization Study.
    
    Gas fluxes are measured at 20 minute sampling intervals. Samples are taken from gas traps by inserting a 10 mL syringe into the rubber septa and drawing 10mL which is used to flush a vented 3 mL glass vial. Glass vials are sealed with a septum. Another 10 mL gas sample is taken from the trap and placed in the glass vial, giving the vial a gas overpressure.  CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O are determined by gas chromatography. CH<sub>4</sub> is analyzed with a flame ionization detector (300 degrees C), while N<sub>2</sub>O is analyzed with a 63Ni electron capture detector (350 degrees C). CO<sub>2</sub> is analyzed using an infrared gas analyzer. Gases  are separated on a Poropak Q column (1.8 m, 80/100 mesh) at 80 degrees C. Carrier gas for CH<sub>4</sub> is nitrogen, while carrier gas for N<sub>2</sub>O is argon/methane (90/10).
  body: "h3. Sampling Procedure: \r\n\
    \r\n\
    # Vials (Exetainer LABCO) should have fresh septa. Number the vials as appropriate (KBS LTER uses 4 sampling times (T0 - T3) per chamber). All vials are numbered with the set ID determined by the user.\r\n\
    # Check chambers for plant growth and damage (rodent etc) prior to sampling. \r\n\
    # Place chamber lids and sample vials next to relevant chambers.\r\n\
    # Check the septa on the chamber lids and replace if needed. Damage by repeated needle insertion occurs.  Inspect the o-ring on each lid for correct placement and / or damage. \r\n\
    # Place a 25G needle into the chamber lid septum to relieve pressure inside chamber during lid placement. Snap the lid onto the installed bucket and IMMEDIATELY start the stopwatch. Mark the time the lid was snapped on the bucket. Remove the needle after the lid is firmly attached. \r\n\
    # Since multiple chamber measurements are made, the stopwatch should run continuously throughout the sampling regime. Do not reset the stopwatch at each chamber. Keep the clock running and write down the time each lid is deployed and each time a sample is taken.\r\n\
    # Insert one needle into the first sample vial (labeled Chamber ID -T 0) to act as a vent. Insert the syringe needle into the chamber lid septum and flush three times by pulling out and then pushing in the syringe (about 10 cm3 should be extracted then reintroduced to mix the chamber air prior to sampling). Repeat chamber air mixing X 3, then draw out a 10 ml sample and inject into the sample vial while the vent needle is in place. Listen for air escaping from the vent needle while vial is flushed. Remove the vent needle from the vial. Reinsert the syringe into the lid septa and mix chamber air 3 additional times before drawing the 10 ml sample. Remove the syringe from the lid septa and inject sample into the vial. RECORD THE SAMPLING TIME WHEN THE AIR SAMPLE IS DRAWN UP IN THE SYRINGE. This is sample T(0). Inject as much of the 10ml sample as possible into the 5.9 ml vial. The over pressure guards against sample contamination and is corrected during analysis. \r\n\
    # Record chamber / vial ID, along with sampling time on data sheet.\r\n\
    # If applicable, record soil temperature / moisture proximal to chamber during sampling period (ie during 1 round of sampling).\r\n\
    # Repeat sampling procedure for all chambers in a given plot / treatment / block etc, recording lid deployment and sampling times for all initial T 0 samples. \r\n\
    # Return to the first sampled chamber and repeat sampling at new time (T 1) for all chambers. KBS LTER takes four samples (T 0 \xE2\x80\x93 T 3) from each chamber over an approximately 1 hour sampling time (i.e., returning to the same chamber approximately every 20 minutes). Prior to actual treatment sampling, tests should be made to ensure fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O are linear over the sampling time period. It is also a good idea to sample ambient air at the beginning and end of each campaign. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Helpful hints: It is easiest to keep track of where you are in the vial sequence by placing the vent needle in the next vial to be used and turning the \"used\" vials upside down in the tray. Some of the septa/vials may leak \xE2\x80\x93 this should be fairly obvious, listen for the leak. If rain is expected, data sheets can be photocopied onto rainproof paper. As a guideline, allow about 1 minute for each sampling procedure. Sample T 0 includes lid deployment, so may take a little longer.  "

    \r\n\
    Bacteria\r\n\
    \r\n\
    All bacteria are non-selectively stained green by this procedure. Observe the bacteria using a fluorescence microscope with a 63 x oil-immersion objective and 1.6 x zoom factor. Excitation filter 450-490 nm, dichroic 510 nm and suppression < 515 nm. Collect 3 images from each smear (3 x 5 = 15 images per sample) (Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera with 512 x 768 pixels each representing 0.089 x 0.089 \xC2\xB5m at this magnification). Measured soil bacteria average 0.9 x 0.4 \xC2\xB5m, which corresponds to about 10 x 5 pixels. The software procedure is set to discard any objects represented by fewer than 5 pixels (smaller than about 0.2 x 0.2 \xC2\xB5m). The bacteria are detected, counted and measured by image analysis (IPLab Spectrum Software, Apple Macintosh PPC computer).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The volume ( bv ) of each bacteria is calculated from measurements of the large, l , and small, d , diameters of each cell by assuming that the cells are prolate spheroids.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Equation for biovolume of bacteria\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Fungi\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Observe the calcofluor M2R (blue) stained fungi under epifluorescence with a 10x objective. Excitation 340-380 nm, dichroic 400 nm and suppression < 430 nm. Fluorescent dyes usually fail to stain heavily melanized hyphae which may be common or prevalent in some soils. The stain detects polysaccharides and does not discriminate living from dead hyphae.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Collect 3 images from each of 5 smears. Pixels represent 0.9 x 0.9 \xC2\xB5m at this magnification. Hyphal fragments are detected and their length and diameter measured by image analysis. Objects with a plan area of less than 100 pixels (81 \xC2\xB5m 2 ) are discarded, as are objects with a \"radial standard deviation of < 35\" - this is a measure of the variance in diameter of the object in different directions, which serves to exclude objects which are not long and thin, including most fungal spores. Hyphal volume for each fragment is calculated assuming the hyphae are simple cylinders of length l and diameter d .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Equation for hyphal volume of Fungi\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mass of soil per image (field of view)\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The initial suspension (200 mL) contains 10 g moist soil, each smear contains 4 \xC2\xB5L of the suspension. Thus each smear contains:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Equation for mass of soil per suspension g soil per smear\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If the diameter of the smear is 6 mm, the area is (9)(pi) mm 2 .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The area of the image is xy mm 2 , where x and y are the dimensions of the counting area in millimeters.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The mass of soil per field ( s ) is given by:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Equation for mass of soil per image g soil per image\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The sum of the volumes of bacteria ( bv )or fungal hyphae ( hv ), divided by the appropriate mass of soil ( s ) represents biovolume per gram soil (\xC2\xB5m 3 g -1 ).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Calculation of biomass\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The biovolume is converted to biomass C using conversion factors for C contents per unit volume. We use 200 fgC \xC2\xB5m -3 for bacteria and 150 fgC \xC2\xB5m -3 for fungi. These factors represent \"best compromise\" values from the available literature.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Image processing procedures\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Image processing steps to measure bacterial and fungal hyphal biovolume in soil smears using IPLab Spectrum v 3.0 image analysis software (Macintosh PPC) are shown below in the form of ?scripts? which are executable lists of processing steps. The software has the capability to repeat the script for each of a list of image files and can in this way automatically analyze numerous images as a batch process. One externally programmed function, the filter?Tophat?(author: D. Harris) , was written in C and incorporated into the IPLab Spectrum software as an external function.\r\n\

    The Top Hat transform operates on each row of pixels in the image, first in the normal orientation of the image, then on the image rotated 90 degrees. The Top Hat is a hat-shaped mask which is moved along the intensity profile of each row of pixels. At each pixel position the Top Hat is raised or lowered to the level of the maximum intensity under the?brim?. Those pixels with values lower than the crown of the hat are set to zero in a new image. Pixels with values greater than the crown of the hat are given values in the newimage equal to the original intensity minus the level of the hatbrim. The effect of the filter is to copy only sharp bright peaks to the new image, eliminating small or low frequency fluctuations in the intensity profile. This background subtraction enables the new image to be segmented at a constant threshold, typically zero(Fig. A1). The parameters of the Top Hat, width and height, define the characteristics of the detected features. Whilst a three dimensional Top Hat could be used to detect bacteria-like features in one pass, the two dimensional Top Hat, two pass process, has the advantage of detecting filaments such as hyphae in addition to compact features like cocci and short rods.\r\n\

    LTER Weather Station Annual Maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to weekly maintenance, annual maintenance may be required for certain instruments.  <a href = "http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/Data/table.jsp?Product=KBS002-003&amp;limitBy=Location&amp;containing=LTERWS&amp;format=record">KBS002-003</a> lists the instruments currently deployed at the weather station.  Check the serial numbers in the field to verify that the list is correct.  Determine how long the device has been deployed by looking up its serial number in <a href = "http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/Data/table.jsp?tools=show&amp;Product=KBS002-004&amp;limitBy=Instrument&amp;format=record">KBS002-004</a>.  Service or replace the instrument as appropriate, referring to the instrument manual on file with the LTER Information manager (summary provided below).  Light, wind, and humidity sensors are typically rotated, i.e.,  swapped for freshly calibrated instruments of the same type, and sent to the manufacturer for recalibration.  Any time an instrument is removed or placed, the event should be reported to the information manager and logged in the instrument tracking system (KBS002-004).  All instruments should be monitored throughout the year, and replaced/serviced if suspect. </p>
    <p>Most instruments can be serviced from the ground, or by climbing a short distance up the tower.  To service wind instruments, a crew of four people can "drop" the tower.  Attach a rope halfway up the tower and have one person handle the rope to control descent.  Carefully remove the retaining bolts on the southwest leg, and lower bolts on the other two legs.  Tower will pivot on remaing bolts.  Slowly lower the tower toward the northeast, using remaining personnel.  Support lowered tower on saw horses to prevent damage to wind instruments or instrument enclosure.  Caution!  Tower is heavy.  Do not attempt this operation without sufficient help.
    </p>
    <p>Instrument-specific comments</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Belfort weighing bucket precipitation gauge:  manual specifies annual cleaning.  Check calibration annually:  1.0 L of water added to the bucket should cause a pen displacement of 24.4 chart units (1.22 inches).  Report the results.</p></li>
    <li><p>HMP45C Temperature and Relative Humidity Probe:  rotate annually.</p></li>
    <li><p>LI200X Pyranometer:  rotate every two years.</p></li>
    <li><p>LI190SB Quantum Sensor:  (Manual does not specify recalibration interval.)  rotate every two years.</p></li>
    <li><p>107 Temperature Probe.  No recalibration or replacement interval is recommended.  Check recent data to see that HMP45C and 107 agree.</p></li>
    <li><p>014A Wind Speed Sensor.  rotate annually (send to Met-One).</p></li>
    <li><p>024A Wind Direction Sensor.  rotate annually (send to Met-One).</p></li>
    </ul>
    </kbsml_text>

    <kbsml_text>
    <p>In addition to weekly maintenance, certain additional tasks must be performed on a yearly basis, such as replacing/recalibrating sensors.

    <h2><a name="1">1 Overview</a></h2>
    
    <p>This document describes information management practices for the KBS LTER, with a special focus on the KBS Information Management System.  Currently, the primary tasks of the KBS LTER information manager include administration of the LTER server (shared with the LTER secretary), administration of the LTER web site (shared with the LTER secretary, special focus on data pages), administration of the KBS LTER Information Management System, and adminstration of the KBS LTER Weather Station.  Some guidance is given regarding network level collaborations in which KBS participates.
    
    </p></div>
    <div>
    <h2><a name="2">2  Business Continuity Plan </a></h2>
    
    <p>In the event of a major unforseen disruption of operations, steps may be taken subsequently to recover investment in data management.  Principally, this means recovery of critical data files.  KBS Computer Services provides a complete backup strategy for most KBS computers.  Backup tapes are stored offsite.

    <h2>Ammonium Reagents</h2>
    
    <h3>Citrate Complexing Reagent (4L)</h3>
    <p>Sodium Citrate 112g</p>
    <p>Sodium Hydroxide 4 g</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 4L</p>
    <p>Brij 35 (30%) 20 ml</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 4L Erlenmeyer flask with nanopure water. Add dry chemicals, stir until dissolved then bring to volume (4L) with nanopure water. Filter reagent then add 20 ml 30% Brij 35 (5 ml / L). This may be stored at room temperature or be refrigerated.</p>
    
    <h3>Alkaline Phenol</h3>
    <p>Sodium Hydroxide (10N or 40% w/v) 80 ml</p>
    <p>Liquid Phenol (88%) 94 ml</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 1 L</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 1L volumetric flask with nanopure water. Place in ice bath and stir while slowly adding sodium hydroxide first, then liquid phenol. Dilute to volume (1 L) with nanopure water and filter. Store refrigerated in light resistant container.</p>
    <p>
    <em>NOTE:</em> This reagent is hazardous waste! Any glassware, paper towels, gloves, filter paper, etc used/contaminated during this process must be treated or disposed of as hazardous waste.</p>
    
    <h3>Sodium Nitroferricyanide (1L)</h3>
    <p>Sodium Nitroferricyanide 0.5 g</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 1L</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 1L volumetric flask with nanopure water. Carefully measure sodium nitroferricyanide and add to nanopure water. Dilute to volume (1L) with nanopure water and filter. Store refrigerated in light resistant container.</p>
    <p>
    <em>NOTE:</em> This reagent is hazardous waste! Any glassware, paper towels, gloves, filter paper, etc used/contaminated during this process must be treated or disposed of as hazardous waste.</p></div>
    <div>
    <h3>10N Sodium Hydroxide (1L)</h3>
    <p>Sodium Hydroxide 400g</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 1L</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 1L volumetric flask with nanopure water and place in ice bath. SLOWLY add sodium hydroxide while stirring to dissolve. This produces an exothermic reaction. Allow solution to cool to room temperature and bring to volume (1L) with nanopure water.</p>
    <p>
    <em>NOTE:</em> This is REALLY messy, nasty stuff to work with so my advice is to buy it already made up.</p></div></div>
    <div>
    <h2>Nitrate/Nitrite Reagents</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>Ammonium Chloride EDTA Buffer (4L)</h3>
    <p>Ammonium Chloride 340 g</p>
    <p>EDTA 0.4 g</p>
    <p>10N Sodium Hydroxide 26+ ml</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 4L</p>
    <p>Brij 35 (30%) 8ml</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 4L Erlenmeyer flask with nanopure water. Add ammonium chloride and EDTA and stir until dissolved. Adjust buffer solution using 10 N sodium hydroxide (start with 26 ml and add from there as needed) to pH 8.50. Dilute to volume (4 L) with nanopure water and filter. Add 8 ml 30% Brij 35 (2 ml / L). Store refrigerated.</p>
    <p>
    <em>NOTE:</em> Keep some of the buffer on hand that does not have Brij 35 added to it. The buffer without Brij is needed to rinse and store the cadmium reduction coil after use. Routinely 1L of the ammonium chloride EDTA buffer is set aside in a separate 1L bottle and 6 ml of Brij 35 is added to the other 3L. Brij can always be added previous to use if necessary but the cadmium coil should not be stored in buffer that has Brij in it.</p>
    
    <h3>Color Reagent (1L)</h3>
    <p>Phosphoric Acid (85%) 100 ml</p>
    <p>Sulfanilimide 40 g</p>
    <p>N-1-Naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride 2g</p>
    <p>Nanopure Water 1 L</p>
    <p>Brij 35 (30%) 2 ml</p>
    <p>Partially fill a 1 L volumetric flask with nanopure water. On stir plate, add phosphoric acid then dry chemicals. Stir until dry chemicals are dissolved. This can take several hours of stirring. Bring to volume (1L) with nanopure water and filter. Add 2ml (2 ml / L) of 30% Brij 35. Store refrigerated in light resistant container.</p>
    
    <h2>Cadmium Coil Reactivation Reagents</h2>
    <p>(see page 16 of The Flow Solution Nitrate/Nitrite Methodology)</p>
    <p>Note: DO NOT use HCl acid every time you recharge.  This causes excessive damage to the coil</p>

    LTER Weather Station Maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
    6-10-2002.  Tim Bergsma.  A maintenance routine for the LTER weather station has become institutionalized, but has not been thoroughly documented.  In 1997 a weighing bucket rain gauge was installed at the station, eventually replacing the tipping bucket rain gauge.  The design of the new gauge requires weekly maintenance visits; some method loosely corresponding to the protocol below has been employed since then.  Details vary.  For instance, copies of the removed charts were made and stored, from 7-29-97 until 10-15-2001.  I am no longer maintaining copies.  No regular log has been kept:  I am institutionalizing the log today.  Details of the operation of the weather station since its initial deployment exist in a variety of forms, and should be available elsewhere.  My purpose here is to create a protocol for weather station maintenance that corresponds to current practice.  Those maintaining the station should document whether this or some other protocol was employed, noting significant deviations, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
    Frequency: weekly (usually Monday, as per labeling of precipitation chart)
    </p>
    <p>
    Materials</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Belfort Instrument Company:  Chart No. 5-4046-B, normally stored in data manager's office.</p></li>
    <li><p>special ink.  Contact Belfort for more information.  Dropper bottle stored at the instrument.</p></li>
    <li><p>pencil</p></li>
    <li><p>soft cloth</p></li>
    <li><p>spare chart drum</p></li>
    <li><p>antifreeze, appropriate containment equipment (funnels, waste containers, etc). </p></li>
    <li><p>Belfort manual.  Currently in folder Weath. Inst. Doc, maintained by the LTER data manager, lter.data.manager@kbs.msu.edu.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Procedure</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Label a new chart with station, date, expected time of deployment (optional) and your initials.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fold the labeled tab under, and mount on spare drum.  Tail of chart overlaps clip such that pen won't snag if it passes the clip.</p></li>
    <li><p>Proceed to weather station.  Visually inspect tower, sensors.</p></li>
    <li><p>Climb tower to examine two light sensors at 3m.  Wipe sensing surfaces with a soft cloth if necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Inspect rain gauge and open the access door.</p></li>
    <li><p>"Ship" the pen and remove the current drum (becomes the spare).</p></li>
    <li><p>Write in pencil directly on the removed chart:  OFF [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].</p></li>
    <li><p>Store the chart/drum for transport. </p></li>
    <li><p>Wind the clock fully (but gently), about 24 strokes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Label the new chart, ON, [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].</p></li>
    <li><p>Place the new drum, seated fully.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add ink to the pen as necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Remove the collection cylinder if necessary for the following.</p></li>
    <li><p>Install or remove the collection funnel as necessary.  Should not be in place if there is risk of snow.</p></li>
    <li><p>Empty bucket if necessary.  Rain water can be dumped locally.  If antifreeze is present, dispose properly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add/remove antifreeze as necessary.  Add if collected precip. is at risk of freezing, remove when diluted to ineffectiveness by precipitation.</p></li>
    <li><p>Replace bucket and collection cylinder as necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place pen against chart, while setting the time.  Set the time by rotating the drum counter-clockwise only (avoids hysteresis error).</p></li>
    <li><p>Start the ink flowing by prodding with a pointed object, if necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Close the access door.</p></li>
    <li><p>Write and submit a log entry, stipulating which maintenance tasks were performed.  Submit directly or by email to lter.data.manager@kbs.msu.edu.</p></li>
    <li><p>Submit chart for processing.</p></li>

    <p>Precipitation is measured using a Belfort Weighing Bucket Preciptiation Gauge.  Staff checks the gauge weekly, changing the chart and emptying the bucket as necessary.  During the winter, antifreeze (ethylene glycol solution) is added to the bucket, which serves to melt snow and protect the bucket.  The paper chart is changed weekly, and read by staff in units of 1/20th of one inch. Database algorythms convert readings to mm.  A date is midnight to midnight local time, either Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time.  During the visit to the station, other sensors are inspected.

    <p>Sampling Frequency: minimum of once per month through the growing season (April -October) </p> <p>Composite soil samples consist of 1-inch composited cores per plot taken to soil depth at each of the 5 baseline sampling stations per plot .  At each sampling station, cores are taken perpendicular to the crop row and between rows .  Soil cores from poplar plots are taken on a diagonal transect between two trees .  In successional plots cores are taken at 7.5&quot; intervals from an arbitrary starting point .  No soil cores are taken across wheel-track rows in any plots .  Soil cores from each plot are sieved and mixed into one soil composite sample  .</p>

  body: |-
    <p>Soil cores are taken at 5 sampling stations per plot. Soil cores (2.5
    cm dia.) are taken north of each station flag to a depth of 25 cm. An
    equal number of cores are taken within row and between row when row
    crops are grown. In non-cropped systems, cores are taken at 10 cm
    intervals. All cores from each plot are composited in one sampling
    bag. A standard sampling consists of 2 cores at each station.  Some
    samplings will have more cores when soil demand is high. Normally
    samplers start at the south end of Rep 1, 2, 3, and 4. They work north
    and finish on the north side of Rep 5. Rep 6 and treatment 8&#146;s
    are sampled after finishing with rep 5. 5. Forested sites are
    collected by one person at the same time the main site is being
    sampled. If 5 people are not available the forested sites maybe
    sampled in the afternoon while soil from the main site is being
    sieved.</p>
    
    <p>The soil is brought to the lab and sieved through a 4 mm screen to
    remove debris and to homogenize the soil sample. Each treatment has a
    specific screen in order to reduce contamination between
    treatments. Latex gloves are worn when sieving and mixing the
    soil.</p>
    
    <p>Field moist sieved soil subsamples are distributed to individuals
    requesting soil prior to sampling. Excess soil is air dried and stored
    by date of sampling. All samples, except the April sample, are
    disposed of at the end of the year. The April sample is archived for
    CN analysis.</p>
    
    <p>Mineralization potential may be assessed by as the difference in
    nitrate and ammonia values from the initial sampling and an
    &quot;incubated&quot; sample. Incubations are perfomed on a subsample
    of the initial composite sample which is placed into a gas-permeable
    plastic bag and buried in the plot from which the soil
    originated. Incubation length is 21 days. (see Short-term
    mineralization file for details).</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Label plastic bags with appropriate information about the
      sample (e.g. project, date, plot, variate. Cover labels with clear
      mailing tape to secure label to bag and to protect against
      moisture.</li>
      <li>Prepare sampling buckets. Each bucket should have the
      following: site map, sharpie marker, butter knife, sampling bags,
      and soil probe.</li>
      <li>Take samples to 25 cm at each of the 5 sampling stations. A
      butter knife is helpful in removing soil from the probe. In cropped
      systems, an equal number of cores should be taken in the crop row
      and between the crop row. Take the same number of cores from
      non-cropped systems. Composite all samples for each plot in one
      plastic bag.</li>
      <li>Tie the sample bag and place in the alleyway to be picked up
      when the sampling is completed. All efforts should be made to
      complete sampling in all plots on the same day.</li>
      <li>Take a core at the edge of the next plot to clean the soil
      probe. This will reduce contamination between plots.</li>
      <li>Pick up soil samples and return to dry lab.</li>
      <li>Separate soils by treatment.</li>
      <li>Wear latex gloves while sieving. Sieve each soil sample using
      the 4 mm mesh soil sieve labeled for that treatment. Sieves are kept
      in the dry lab.</li>
      <li>Sieve soil into a plastic tote tray. Return sieved soil to the
      plastic sample bag. Discard rocks and large organic matter remaining
      on the screen.</li>
      <li>Brush sieve and tote tray clean.</li>

  description: ""
  abstract: |
    The amount of foliage in a vegetative canopy can be deduced from measurement of how quickly radiation is attenuated as it passes through the canopy. By measuring this attenuation at several angles from the zenith, foliage orientation information can be obtained. The LAI2000 measures the attenuation of diffuse sky radiation at five zenith angles simultaneously. The LAI-2050 optical sensor projects the image of nearly hemisphere view onto five detectors arranged in concentric rings. Thus if the sensor is level and viewing the sky, detector 1 will measure the brightness straight overhead, while detector 5 will measure the brightness of a ring centered at 68<sup>o</sup> zenith angle (22<sup>o</sup> above the horizon),subtending 13<sup>o</sup>.
    
    !http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/data_images/kbs058-prot06.png(LAI diagram)!
    
    A measurement with the LAI-2000 consists of a minimum of ten numbers: five of the numbers are signals from the five detectors when the optical sensor was above the vegetation, and the remaining five are the readings made by the sensor below the vegetation. For both the readings, the sensor is looking up at the sky. Five values of canopy transmittance are calculated from these readings by dividing corresponding pairs. For example if the detector reads 50 (units not important) above the canopy and 5 below, then the transmittance at that angle (centered at 70 ) is 5/50=0.10.From transmittance at all five zenith angles, the LAI-2000 calculates foliage amount (leaf area index, LAI) and foliage orientation (mean foliage tilt angle, MTA).In practice, a number of below-canopy readings are usually made to improve the spatial average.

      <p>Samples are taken from each of the 5 sampling stations in each treatment replicate in
      the LTER main site (7 trts * 6 reps; in 1994 the forested sites were added to the sampling
      regime). The sampling location is 1 m to the southwest of the sampling flag; 10 cores (1
      inch diameter) to a depth of 15 cm are taken from a quadrat area of 25*25 cm. Cores are
      uniformly distributed in the quadrat.</p>
      <p>Each core is divided into 2 depth intervals: 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm. The 10 cores from each
      quadrat are composited and placed in separately labeled paper bags. Each bag is labeled
      with the trt/rep/sample location and depth. The 2 bags from each sample location are
      placed in a ziplock bag. Samples are stored in the dark at 5 degrees C until elutriated
      following methods in Gross and Renner (1989). Storing the samples at cool temperatures
      should prevent germination and facilitate elutriation as the samples will not form &quot;
      peds&quot; as a consequence of drying.</p>
    
    
    <p><em>Microplots:</em></p>
    
    
      <p>A single location is sampled from the center of each of the 4 microplots (+/-
      fertilizer; +/- herbicide) at 30&quot; row spacing in all reps of trts 1 and 2
      (conventional and notill). In the no fertilizer treatments, the samples are taken from the
      middle of the first 6 rows to avoid areas that were accidentally fertilized in 1989. All
      other samples are taken form the center of the 12 row microplot. </p>
    
    
    <p><em>Comments:</em></p>
    
    
      <p>Treatment 8 was not sampled. Treatment 1 (conventional till) will be resampled after it
      is plowed to determine how tillage effects the distribution and viability of seeds in the
      seed bank. If these samples are taken more than 2 weeks after the main site sampling was
      done, the no-till plots will be resampled f or a comparison of time effects. </p>

    Sampling Frequency: Weekly and/or Precipitation-Event Basis
    
    CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes are estimated using in situ closed-cover flux chambers.  Bases of the chambers (28 cm x 28 cm x 10 cm high) are permanently installed in all plots of 4 replicate blocks (removed only for farming activities).  Chamber bases are constructed from aluminum sheeting with a channel on the top outside rim to fit a plexiglass cover (29 cm x 29 cm x 14 cm high) fitted with a rubber septa.  Base channels are filled with water during sampling to provide a gas-tight seal.</p><p>Gas fluxes are measured at 40 minute sampling intervals over a 3 hour period.  Samples are taken from gas traps by inserting a 10 mL syringe into the rubber septa and drawing 10mL which is used to flush a vented 3 mL glass vial.  Glass vials are sealed with butyl septa and crimped with a standard crimp seal.  Another 10 mL gas sample is taken from the trap and placed in the glass vial, giving the vial a gas overpressure of 7 mL.  CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O are determined by gas chromatography.  CH<sub>4</sub>is analyzed with aflame ionization detector (300 degrees C), while N<sub>2</sub>O is analyzed with a 63Ni electron capture detector (350 degrees C).  CO<sub>2</sub> is analyzed using an infrared gas analyzer.  Gases for both CH4 and N2O are separated on a Poropak Q column (1.8 m, 80/100 mesh) at 80 degrees C.  Carrier gas for CH<sub>4</sub> is nitrogen, while carrier gas for N<sub>2</sub>O is argon/methane (90/10).</p></kbsml_text>

    h2. Field Gas Sampling Protocol
    
    Field Sampling: Usually April to November
    
    Treatments 1 through 8, CF and SF are sampled with one chamber per replicate, DF are sampled with two chambers per replicate. Starting in 2008 only one chamber was sampled in the DF plots.
    
    h3. Equipment
    
    <div class='bulleted'>
    
    * Tins or plastic bags: for soil samples (1 per chamber) 
    * Knife: for inserting chamber base in soil 
    * Small Level: for leveling chamber base 
    * Rubber Mallet: for hammering base 
    * Wood Block (2" x 4" x 18"): for hammering base, where necessary 
    * Soil Probe 
    * Syringe - 20mL 
    * Needles 18 gauge (gray) (at least 10 per person) 
    * Septa (from 3 ml venoject vials): for lids  
    * Water in squirt bottle: for sampling square chambers 
    * Vials (crimped, sealed, and labeled), 4 per chamber 
    * Stop watch 
    * Soil thermometer (Taylor small dial thermometers with 13 cm stems) 
    * Ruler: to measure chamber height 
    * Field apron or equivalent: for carrying supplies 
    * Pencils 
    * Data sheets 
    * Clippers 
    * Gas box frames for square chambers: 
    ** Gas box base (aluminum, 27.3cm x 27.3cm x 10cm) - permanently installed in site 
    ** Gas box lid (29cm x 29cm x 14cm) 
    * Gas box frames for round chambers </p>
    ** Chamber base (PVC, 25cm dia.) - permanently installed in plots
    **  Chamber cap 
    ** Elastic band 
    
    </div>
    
    h3. Preparation
    
    # Place chamber base in ground, bottom edge approximately 1 inch below surface.  The frames must be level.  On badly sloping sites, this can be achieved by carefully hammering a wooden 2 x 4 placed over the top of the base; use a level to check angle.  Frames should be set into ground at least 1 day before sampling; they remain in the soil until winter, and are not removed between sampling times except for plowing treatments. 
    # Plant growth within the box frames needs to be clipped to base height (do not clip to soil surface) without disturbing the soil prior to sampling.  Litter is left in place.  The area inside the frame should be as representative as possible to the area outside the frame. 
    # Vials need to be crimped prior to sampling date.  Number of boxes *4 sampling times (T0 - T3) = number of vials needed.  all vials are numbered with the set ID, then vial #'s 1 - 210 (for a full campaign, excluding fertilizer sites; 1 - 136 for treatments 1 - 8 only), for gas sample identification. 
    # It is a good idea to check the boxes (frames and lids) for plant growth and damage, and to level the frames and clean the lids the day before sampling. 
    # The chamber lids need to be kept clean; clean the inside with water (only) before each use.  The epoxy seals lining the edges of the box lid should be checked by filling the boxes with water - look for leaks.  We've also been sealing the bottom channel on the gas box frames to prevent leaking. 
    # Frame height measured. 
    
    h3. Sampling
    
    # Stay on trails - do not trample plants or compress soil near chamber. 
    # Record T0 soil temperature on data sheet; temperature probe should be inserted 10 cm. 
    # Record gas box lid type - it will be marked on the top (A, B, or C).  Record height at 4 places. 
    # Check the frames for obvious cracks.  Fill the frame troughs with water (square chambers) without spilling water onto the soil (added water may stimulate biological activity). 
    # Check septa on the box lids and replace if needed; they get dirty and gooey as they weather. 
    #  Sample chambers
    ## Square Chambers
    ###  Place PVC lid on frame and check to see if a proper seal has formed; if lid has been laying flat on the ground, wave it around to make sure you're not just moving the air that has been trapped inside for weeks directly onto the frame. To ensure the seal is good, gently pull lid up and feel for suction or check water level.
    ### Flush the sample vial with air from the chamber using a vent needle. Remove the vent needle and inject sample. For 5 ml vials, we usually flush with 10mL and inject with as much of an additional 10mL as possible. (The over pressure guards against sample contamination, and provides an easy means for removing known volumes from the vial during gas analysis). For large (10mL) vials, flush with 30 mL and add an additional 10 mL.
    ## Round Chambers
    ### Place the PVC lid on frame and seal by putting an elastic band around latex skirt.
    ### Flush the sample vial using the 3-way stopcock and tubing (this keeps the chamber from moving when removing samples). For large (10 ml) vials, flush with 30 mL of chamber air and add an additional 10 mL.
    # Start timer after the first sample is injected into the vial; record vial number and time on data sheet.
    # Use soil probe to take soil sample to 25 cm for moisture (and nitrate if desired) at least 0.5 m away from chamber. Put sample in tin or plastic bag.
    # Fill 3 vials with ambient air taken above your head; overfill vials as for chamber samples. These samples are to check for vial effects.
    
    Helpful hints: It is easiest to keep track of where you are in the vial sequence by placing the vent needle in the next vial to be used and turning the "used" vials upside down in the tray. Some of the septa/vials may leak - this should be fairly obvious, listen for the leak. If rain is expected, data sheets can be photocopied onto rainproof paper.
    
    h3. Analysis
    
    In the lab, analyze vials for CH<sub>4</sub> (using the GC-FID), N<sub>2</sub> O (GC-ECD), and CO<sub>2</sub (IRGA). Analyze CH<sub>4</sub> prior to N<sub>2</sub> O, because the ECD carrier gas contains 10% CH<sub>4</sub> you will contaminate CH<sub>4</sub> samples with carryover from the ECD injection port. Samples should be analyzed within a day or two of collection, or else you may start having some problems due to the sample vial septa. Among the problems you might encounter are septa absorbing the compound you are interested in, the septa giving off the compound, or the septa giving off a different compound that interferes with analysis of your compound. (If prompt analysis is not possible, store standards in sample vials the same day you collect your samples. That way what ever happens to your samples will also be happening to your standards, and your standard curves should generate reasonable sample ppms).
    
    Run a full set of standards at the beginning and end of a run; r ^2^ should be >0.99. Run a check standard every 10 - 15 samples and if off more than 10%, run full standards.
    
    h3. Calculation
    
    To convert ppm/min to grams of compound per hectare per day, use to following formula:
    Equation to calculate flux
    <img alt="Equation to calculate flux" src="http://lternt2.kbs.msu.edu/Data/LTER_Image.jsp?Image=KBS013-equation.gif"/>
    where a is the slope in ppm/min, b is the headspace volume of the container in Liters and c is the molecular weight of the compound.

    <kbsml_text>
    <p><em>Setting up the elutriator</em></p>
    
      <p>Turn on air until the needle reads across from the black 20. Turn
      on water to 70 psi.  Both these gauges should be checked regularly;
      during elutriation water should be at 30-40 psi.</p>
    
      <p><em>Processing samples</em></p>
    
      <p>Before pouring the soil into the chamber, break up all large
      clumps of soil and turn on the chamber to allow it to fill halfway
      with water. Add sample, making sure sieve system is in correct order
      of (from top to bottom) 710, 425, and 243 at the bottom. Elutriate
      0-5 cm samples for 10 minutes and 5-15 samples for 15 minutes. When
      the sample is done, remove all connecting chamber and sieve systems
      and rinse through into sieves to make sure nothing is left in the
      arm. As you take apart the system of sieves and connectors, rinse
      through each part into the next sieve down. Empty chamber and turn
      on, allowing it to rinse out for a few seconds.</p>
    
    <p><em>Filtering samples</em></p>
    
      <p>243 sieves should always be placed in the large funnels to be
      rinsed out. For 0-5 cm samples, the 425 and 710 sieves can be placed
      in smaller funnels unless the sample is unusually large. For 5-15 cm
      samples, the 425 is placed in a large funnel and the 710 is placed
      in a small funnel. It helps to wet the filter paper before placing
      the sieve in the funnel. Rinse off the outside of the sieve and
      rinse through screen, brushing lightly wit the tip of the water
      bottle to knock off material that is sticking. Use a spatula to
      remove all seeds that remain on the inside of the sieve after
      rinsing. The filter paper is easiest to remove from the funnel with
      the pump still on. If seeds have slipped down underneath the filter
      paper, rinse out of funnel onto filter paper. Place filter paper in
      appropriately labeled petri dish, not fully covering so that the
      filter paper will not dry and seeds will not germinate. When the
      filter paper is dry, cover the petri dish and tape securely for
      storage.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><em>Suggestions</em></p>
    
    
    
      <p>Label petri dishes and filter paper ahead of each sample. </p>
      <p>Use white grease to keep sieves and connectors from sticking
      together. Avoid getting grease in the mesh on the sieves because it
      will cause seeds to stick and water to back up. </p>
      <p>Make sure the chamber you are using has three functioning air jets. </p>
      <p>The pump should read at 200 or above on the red scale when it is
      functioning properly.  If this is not the case, there could be
      several causes:1) all connections with hoses should be tight; 2) the
      rubber stoppers should be pressed into the beakers as tightly as
      they can be; 3) the switch on the funnel should be in the vertical
      position when that funnel is on; 4) try to limit the number of
      funnels you have on at any one time; 5) make sure no water can get
      into the pump by emptying the beaker out frequently.</p>

    <kbsml_text><p>Sampling Frequency: minimum of once per month through the growing season (April -October)</p><p>The chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976) is used to estimate microbial biomass C and N.  Triplicate subsamples from the composite soil sample of each plot (30 g freshweight) are placed inside 50 ml glass beakers.  Two treatments, control and fumigated, are used.  Samples designated for fumigation are placed in a vacuum desiccator lined with moist paper towels.  Acid washed chloroform is placed in a 50 ml beaker in the center of the desiccator.  The desiccator is sealed, placed in a laboratory hood and evacuated, allowing the chloroform to boil for approximately 30 secs.  The boiling is repeated 4 times.  Samples are incubated for 24 h in the chloroform vapor-saturated atmosphere.  At the end of theincubation period the desiccator is vacuum air-flushed 8 times in order to remove the chloroform.  Samples are removed from the desiccator, placed in quart wide mouth canning jars and sealed with lids fitted with rubber septa for gas sampling.  At the same time, unfumigated soil samples are placed in canning jars and treated in the samefashion, serving as controls.  Evolved CO<sub>2</sub> is measured using a TCD gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column.  Biomass C, Bc, is derived from the relationship:</p><p>Bc = Fc/Kc</p><p>where Fc = [ (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from fumigated soil during the 10 day incubation) - (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from the control during the 10 d incubation)] and Kc = 0.41.</p><p>Biomass N is estimated by measuring the flush of 2 M KCl extractable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> at the end of the 10 d incubation period.  A 10 g subsample of the fumigated and unfumigated incubated samples is taken and analyzed for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>N.  Microbial biomass N, Bn, is derived using the equation:</p><p>Bn = Fn/Kn</p><p>where Fn = [( N mineralized by a fumigated soil for the 10 d incubation period) - (N mineralized by the unfumigated soil)] and Kn = [-0.14 (CO<sub>2</sub>-C evolved from fumigated soil over the 10 day incubation period/N mineralized by the fumigated soil over the 10 day fumigation period) + 0.39].</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Preparation:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Place metal frames in ground, bottom edge approximately 1in below surface.  The frames must be level to
    hold  water in and maintain a proper air-tight seal at sampling.  (On badly sloping sites, this can be achieved
     by  carefully hammering a wooden 2 x 4 placed over the top [the channel is on the top] of the base; use a
    level  to  check anle).  Frames should be set into ground at least 1 day before sampling; they remain in the
    soil  until  winter, and are not removed between sampling times except for plowing treatments.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Plant growth within the box frames needs to be clipped without disturbing the soil prior to sampling
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Vials need to be crimped prior to sampling date.  Number of boxes * 4sampling times(T0-T3) = number of
    vials  needed.  All vials are numbered with the set ID, then vials #'s 1-210 (for a full campaign, excluding
    fertilizer sites; 1-136 for treatments 1-8 only), for gas sample identification.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>It is a good idea to check the boxes (frames and lids) for plant growth and damage, and to level the frames

    <li><p>The box lids need maintenance work on occasion.  The epoxyseals lining the edges of the box lid should be

    <ol>
    <li><p>Record T0 soil temperature on data sheet.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Record gas box lid type- it will be marked on the top (A,B, or C)
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Check the frames for obvious cracks.  Fill the frame troughs with water without spilling water onto the
    soil  (added water may stimulate biological activity).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Check septa (venoject) on the box lids and replace if needed; they get dirty and gooey as they weather.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Place PVC lid on frame and check to see if a proper seal has formed; if lid has been laying flat on the
    ground,  make sure you're not just moving the air that's been trapped inside for weeks directly onto the frame.
      Gently  pull lid up and feel for suction or check water level
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Flush the sample vial with air from the chamber using a vent neele.  Remove the vent needle and inject
    sample.   We usually flush with 10ml and inject as much as of an additional 10ml as possible (The over pressure
     gaurds  against sample contamination, and provides an easy means for removing known volumes from the vial
    during gas  analysis).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Start timer as the first sample is injected into the vial; record vial number and time on data sheet.
    </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Helpful hints: It is easiest to keep track of where you are in the vial sequence by placing the vent needle
    in the next vial to be used and turning the &quot;used&quot; vials upside down in the tray.  Some of the
    septa/vials may leak - this shouls be fairly obvious, listen for the leak.  If rain is expected, data sheets
    can be photocopied onto rainproof paper.

    <p>In the lab, analyze vials for CH4 (using the GC-FID), N2O (GC-FID), and CO2 (IRGA).  Analyze prior N2O,
    because  the ECD carrier gas contains 10% CH4- you will contaminate CH4 samples with carryover from the ECD

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Soil moisture content affects microbial activity, nutrient
    movement, and plant growth. Soil moisture content is needed to
    calculate other soil biological parameters (e.g. N mineralization) on
    a common (dry weight of soil) basis. The gravimetric method calculates
    soil moisture by the difference between the fresh weight and dry
    weight of a given soil sample.</p>
    
    
    </div><div><h2>General Procedure</h2>
    
    
    <p>Soil moisture samples are taken from the sieved soil samples at the
    same time nitrogen mineralization samples are being weighed.  This
    reduces the amount of time spent on handling the soil samples and
    provides moisture availability for mineralization calculations.</p>

      from oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. </p>
      <p>7. Tare scale to zero. Place each individual bag containing soil
      on scale and record weight in lab book. Weigh empty paper bags and
      record as bag tare weight.</p>
      <p>8. Dispose of soil unless needed for C/N

    <h3>Introduction
    </h3>
    
    <p>A key aspect of establishing a long term program in insect
    spatial and temporal dynamics is the development of a sampling
    protocol. This includes the use of a standard method of
    measurement for the species assemblage being monitored and the
    use of permanent sample site locations distributed throughout the
    landscape at known geographic locations. The application of
    permanent sampling sites was used to account for differences in
    time (weeks, years) without the complication of spatial
    variation. A new sampling protocol was developed for the insect
    monitoring within the KBS-LTER. Several factors were considered
    when developing the method used to sample the selected insect
    groups: a) a method which could be used in different habitats; b)
    simple to maintain the sample device; c) low cost; d) ease of
    removal of the sample device due to agronomic practices, e)
    ability to sample a large number of locations over a sizeable
    geographic area, and, f) independent of the observer. Six years
    of consistent data have been collected weekly from May-August
    from 210 permanent sample locations from the main LTER site.
    Presently, 285 stations are sampled weekly over a 12-14 week
    period each year.</p>
    
    <p>To satisfy these constraints, a colored (yellow) sticky trap
    is used to sample plant dwelling predators (coccinellids,
    chrysopids, lampyrids). The pitfall trap is used to sample ground
    dwelling predators (carabids, arachnids, staphylinids). The
    pitfall trap is a common method to record ground dwelling
    invertebrate predators. The use of the sticky trap is less
    commonly used. The consistency of patterns of catch of plant
    dwelling predators during the six-year study has indicated that
    sticky traps have the same advantages and disadvantages of the
    pitfall trap. The use of the selected trapping methods has
    provided the possibility to conduct the study at larger scales
    with more groups of invertebrates (other than ground dwelling
    arthropods), which has enhanced the understanding of the way that
    invertebrates interact with the landscape.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Plant dwelling insect predators
    </h3>
    
    <p>At each sampling station we place one insect trap. Each trap
    consists of a double sided cardboard yellow sticky trap (unbaited
    Pherocon, Zoecon, Palo Alto, CA) suspended 1.2 m above the ground
    as described in the next figure.</p>
    
    <p>Insect adults are sampled weekly during the growing season
    (approximately from early May to late August). Insect are
    identified in the field (using a pictorial key), recorded on
    sampling sheets, and removed from the traps. Yellow sticky traps
    are replaced every two weeks. All the data and ancillary
    information are entered into a computer using a statistical
    spreadsheet for maintenance and analysis.</p>
    
    <p>In 1995, we initiated the use of a Newton 110 PDA (personal
    digital assistant) to substitute for sampling sheets in the
    field. A special set of sampling software, designed initially for
    plant dwelling insect sampling needs, but with potential for
    other sampling protocols, allowed direct capture of all plant
    dwelling insect directly on the field. At the end of each day
    data are downloaded directly into a relational database system
    for subsequent data management and analysis. </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in soil solution. This
    measure is generally considered an index of the acid or base intensity of a soil. The pH
    reading is a product of complex electrode behavior with the soil suspension and
    differences in soil:solution ratio, electrolyte concentration of the soil suspension, and
    spatial placement of the electrode can affect this reading (Mclean 1982). Soil acidity has
    a direct effect on the plant and is a major factor affecting nutrient availability to
    plants.</p>

    <p>Field moist soil is weighed to 15g (14.98 to 15.02 g) into 2 replicate
    extraction cups. Cups are capped after weighing to avoid moisture loss. Using a repipet or
    graduated cylinder 30 ml deionized water is added to each cup, capped and shaken for a
    few seconds. The cap is removed to allow the solution to equilibrate with the atmosphere
    for at least 30 minutes. The pH meter is standardized at pH 7 and 4.</p>
    
    <p>While gently swirling the slurry the electrode is placed into the
    slurry. pH is measured to the nearest 0.01. Between samples the electrode is rinsed with
    deionized water.</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p>Put pH buffer solutions in 50 mL beakers. Have four 100 ml beakers on
      hand for rinsing the electrode and a squirt bottle filled with nanopure water.</p>
    </li><li><p>Remove the electrode from the storage buffer and remove the small cap
      from the fill hole (on the side of the electrode near the top). Rinse the tip of the
      electrode liberally with deionized water now and each time it is removed from a solution.</p>
    </li><li><p>Press &quot;MODE&quot; to select pH and press &quot;CAL&quot; to
      start the calibration sequence. The prompt display will alternate between &quot;&lt; 1PT
      CAL&quot; and &quot;2PT CAL &gt;&quot;.</p>
    </li><li><p>Press the black button to the right of the display for 2-point
      calibration.</p>
    </li><li><p>The prompt will read &quot;CAL 1 &gt;&quot;. If the displayed buffer
      value reads &quot;7.00&quot;, press the right button indicated by the flashing
      &quot;&gt;&quot;. If not, enter &quot;7.00&quot; on the keypad, then press the indicated
      button. The readout will show the value of the first buffer and the prompt will read
      &quot;CAL 1 = &quot;.</p>
    </li><li><p>The prompt display will then read &quot;CAL 2 &gt;&quot;. Proceed as
      above (Step 4), entering &quot;4.00&quot;. The readout will show the value of the second
      buffer and the prompt will read &quot;CAL 2 =&quot;.</p>
    </li><li><p>The prompt will then flash between &quot;MEASURE&quot; and &quot;CAL
      1&quot;. Rinse the electrode and place the electrode in the pH 7 buffer, and press the
      orange &quot;=&quot; button to start the measurement. Do not place electrode against the
      bottom of the cup; this will affect the reading.</p>
    </li><li><p>The prompt will read &quot;CAL 1&quot;. When the reading stabilizes,
      again press &quot;=&quot;.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The quartz lysimeters are designed to pull soil solution at low suction (-0.5 atm or 38 cm Hg).  The soil
    solution (leachate) is harvested by attaching a sealed and evacuated flask to a small diameter sample line
    connected to the lysimeter.  Over a period of 24 h, the pressure differential between the soil solution and
    leachate collected within the flask reaches a state of equilibrium.  Flasks containing leachate are transferred
      to the laboratory.  The leachate is filtered with glass fiber filters, stored in polyethelene vials, and
    frozen  until analyzed for inorganic N and dissolved organic N using flow spectrophotometry.

    <kbsml_text><h2>KBS LTER GPS Protocol</h2>
    
      <h2>Materials</h2>
    
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
    
      <p>The KBS LTER has two identical Trimble GPS units. "GPS I" is
      to be used exclusively by the KBS LTER staff. "GPS II" can be
      loaned to others with permission by the LTER Project Manager.</p>
    
      <p>Two components make up each GPS unit: the Trimble Data logger
      type TSCe with touch screen, and the Trimble Receiver Type Pro
      XRS model 33302-51.</p>
    
      <p>The GPS can be used in temperatures from -4 F to 140 F. The
      logger is designed to withstand accidental immersion so it should
      be fine to use it in the rain.</p>
    
      <p>The data logger is set to power off after 10 minutes of
      inactivity to conserve the batteries.</p>
    
      <p>Start, Settings, Control Panel, Power Off tab, &lt;On
      Batteries suspend after: 10 minutes&gt;</p>
    
      <h3>Software</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <li>TerraSync - Used for collecting and updating GPS data on
        the Trimble data logger.</li>
    
        <li>Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office (Version 2.9)- Used to manage
        and process GPS data on the PC.</li>
    
        <li>Microsoft Active Sync 3.1.0.9558 - Used to connect your PC
        to the Trimble Data Logger in order to transfer data.</li>
    
        <li>Omnistar is a GPS service that gives real-time
        differential correction. The Omnistar service will be
        maintained on "LTER GPS I", if funding allows. Omnistar service
        will not be purchased for LTER GPS II unless another user
        requests to borrow the unit and pays for the Omnistar service.
        See the Appendix for service details.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h2>Set Up</h2>
    
      <h3>GPS Mission Planning</h3>
    
      <p>GPS mission planning allows you to determine what time of day
      the satellites are in suboptimum position so that you can avoid
      collecting GPS data during these times. Mission planning is
      critical when collecting GPS data in forested areas or other
      challenging sites (see "Collecting Data in Trees or near
      Obstructions" in the Appendix).</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>The Planning Software should be installed on the two
        computer's in the Robertson Lab that have Trimble's GPS
        Pathfinder Office software, however, if it is not installed
        then do the following.

  abstract: |-
    Sampling frequency: Monthly basis from August 2008.
    
    Where used, ion resin strips are placed in the field for 1 month starting from March to November. Three pairs of anion and cation strips (2.5 cm x 10cm) are placed in each plot (1 pair at each of 3 stations). After one month, strips are collected by plot and both anion and cation strips (6 strips total) are put in the same 250 mL vial for that plot. After bringing the vials into the laboratory, percentage area remaining on each strip is measured using a small template (15 cm x 20 cm). Strips are then cleaned with deionized water to remove visible soil and then placed in plastic tubs with 2.0 M KCl (35 mL/strip) and shaken at 40 rpm for 1 hour. The extract (5ml) is stored in 7 mL polyethylene scintillation vials and frozen until analysis. Extracted strips can be regenerated with 0.5 M HCl and 0.5 M NaHCO3 prior to next use.
  body: "<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\
    <p>Ion exchange resins can be used to measure relative amounts of plant-available nutrient ions in soils and the rates at which they are released from soil organic matter. Typical ion exchangers are ion exchange resins (functionalized porous or gel polymer), zeolites, montmorillonite, clay, and soil humus. They are either negatively charged exchangers that capture positively charged ions (cations) or anion exchangers that capture negatively charged ions (anions). There are also amphoteric exchangers that are able to exchange both cations and anions simultaneously. Ion exchange resins are widely used for assessing soil nitrogen availability and its spatial distribution. Anion-exchange membranes sorb nitrate ions (NO3\xE2\x88\x92) and cation-exchange membranes sorb ammonium ions (NH4+).  Direct placement of ion-exchange resin strips in soils has proven to be a simple and effective method for assessing relative ammonium and nitrate-release rates by mineralization among different soils. Acting as an ion sink over a certain period in a manner similar to plant roots, in situ extraction can overcome the disadvantages of extractions that are inherently static and do not account for the kinetics of nutrient release and transport.</p>\r\n\

    </ul>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <h3>Procedure</h3>\r\n\
    <ol>\r\n\
    <li>Cut ion sheets into 2.5 x 10 cm strips using the large plastic template. Once cut, punch a star shaped hole on one end of the cation strips and a rectangle shaped hole in one end of the anion strips to distinguish between the two types of resin.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Regenerate ion strips to remove existing nutrient ions. This step must be performed prior to every use whether new or reused. Place the cation and anion strips into separate and labeled plastic tubs with a lid. Fill the tubs to fully cover strips with 0.5 M HCl (hydrochloric acid). Place the tubs on a shaker table and shake at 40 rpm for at least one hour. </li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Pour off HCl into a beaker in the sink and neutralize with 0.5 M NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), taking care to not add so much that it bubbles over the edge of the beaker. Use pH paper to ensure that the acid has been neutralized before washing the solution down the sink.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Soak the strips in 0.5 M NaHCO3 in the same plastic tubs and shake them at 40 rpm for at least five hours. Change the solution once every hour during this process and discard the used solution every time.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Rinse the strips with deionized H2O and place anion and cation strips into separate, labeled clean Ziploc bags. Add some deionized H2O into the bags to keep the strips moist until placed in soil.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>For placing the strips into soil at designated places, create two vertical slits each about 10 cm deep in the soil using a putty knife or trowel.  One slit is for a cation strip and the other for an anion strip. In row crops, place one pair in the row and another pair between the rows. If desired, a third pair can be inserted midway between the first two pairs. Carefully remove a strip from the bag without introducing any soil particles into the bag (gently push strip up from the outside of the bag before grabbing). Place the strip into the soil so that 5 mm of the hole-punched end is above the soil surface. Firmly close the slit by hand to create contact between the soil and the strip. Mark the sample site with a flag. To avoid the rodent damage, the site should be covered with wire mesh cage (12x12x1.5cm).</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li> After one month, carefully pull the strip from the soil using fingers or needle nose pliers (pull the strip directly vertical to prevent cracking). Gently brush the strip with a wire or plastic brush to remove as much soil as possible. Place all anion and cation strips from one plot into the same 237 ml specimen cup, cap it, and bring back to the lab in a plastic tub. There will be a little soil left on the strips which can be removed later in the laboratory.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>In the laboratory, measure the percentage of the original area that remains on each strip (some area may be missing due to rodent or other damage).  Templates with little squares (each square represents 2.5% of the total area) can be easily made.  Keep them in Ziploc bags so that they can be washed.  This estimate goes in the \"% remaining\" column in the excel spreadsheet.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Add a squirt of deionized water to each cup, recap, and shake by hand.  Open the cup again, pour out the water, and shake it vigorously until most of the water is out.  Inspect for remaining debris and repeat process if there is obvious soil left in cup.  This process should remove nearly all of the remaining soil.</li>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <li>Add 35 ml of 2.0 M KCl per strip to each cup containing all strips from a plot (e.g. 210 mL for 6 strips). Make sure cap is tight and place plastic tub containing cups on the shaker. Shake for one hour at 40 rpm. After shaking,  filter the extract with a syringe filter using a Type A/E, 1um pore size, glass fiber filter. Rinse a labeled scintillation vial  with extract and pour enough to fill up to the shoulder to allow expansion of the solution in the freezer. Place labeled scintillation vials into the freezer for future analysis. Remove strips from the cups, separate them into cation and anion tubs, and prepare for regeneration.</li>\r\n\

    <p>
    Free carbonates are compounds that coat soil particles. They form under certain conditions such as in dry climates where the pH is above 7.  They are also found in some soil profiles that have parent materials made of carbonates (such as limestone).</p>
    <p>
    Carbonate can be detected by measuring the CO2 generated by dissolving the carbonates. By dissolving carbonates in a fixed volume, the pressure increase in samples relative to the blanks will indicate the CO2 generated by carbonate dissolution.  The Ideal Gas Law can be used to calculate the moles of CO2 in the headspace, from which the approximate quantity of carbonate can be estimated, and results can be expressed as % of total dry weight using the amount of soil that was added.  Short- and long-term increases in pressure can be assumed to reflect calcite and dolomite, respectively.</p>

    <p>\r\n Soil samples ideally would be dried and finely ground (< 0.5-mm diameter) to facilitate reaction with acid. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <h2>Procedure</h2>\r\n\
    <ol>\r\n\
    <li>Weigh approximately 1.0 g (+/- 0.2 g) of dry soil into the vial, recording the exact weight. Seal the vial with the cap and septum.</li>\r\n\
    <li>Inject 2 mL of the 5-M HCl into the vial and mix it with the soil, holding it in the hood and pointing the top away from you just in case the septum blows out. Wear safety glasses from this step onward.  Also inject acid into a couple of vials containing 1.0 g of carbonate-free soil to serve as blanks.</li>\r\n\
    <li>After 10 minutes, mix the solution again and record the pressure using the transducer.  The 10-min period is necessary for full dissolution of calcite.</li>\r\n\
    <li>Remove the vial from the transducer and briefly open the vial to vent excess pressure wearing safety glasses, and then seal the cap again.</li>\r\n\
    <li>Measure pressure in the system again after 2-4 hours. Record time and pressure to check for additional dissolution of carbonate. Any pressure increase between 10 min and 2 hours is most likely due to dolomite dissolution.</li>\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) is measured at the KBS LTER in habitats ranging from annual cropping systems to deciduous forests. The diverse plant communities in these habitats require different harvest and/or sampling methods. All measurements are taken pre-harvest at peak annual biomass for major community components. This generally means physiological maturity for annuals and pre-senescence for perennials; most treatments are thus sampled at least twice per year depending on the life history of community components (e.g. corn vs. winter annuals in Treatment 1) and on agronomic harvest frequency (e.g. 3-4 times per year for alfalfa). If possible, biomass samples are taken from each of the five sampling stations within a plot, although labor, weather, and time constraints may alter the number of sampling stations for a given harvest.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For Treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and SF (successional field) ANPP is assessed by harvesting all the above ground portion of plants that are rooted within the bounds of the harvest quadrat. The quadrat size totals 1 m 2 but the dimensions vary depending on the crop row spacing in the annual systems (T1-4) and are described in Table 1. The quadrat size for T5-SF is 0.5 by 2.0 m (1m 2 ). Quadrats are oriented with the long side in an east - west direction. This direction is perpendicular to the crop rows (in planted systems) and allows for assessment of both the row and interrow plant communities. All plants within the quadrat are clipped at ground level, bagged, and stored at 4 degrees C until botanical separations are performed. Harvested plants are separated by species and identified using the five-letter Bayer code system (Weed Science, 1984). Six letter codes are used for woody species, using the first three letters of both genus and species to create the code. In some cases plants are composited into crop and non dominant plant component. Crops are further separated into seed and stover. Plants are dried at 60 degrees C for a minimum of 48 hours and dry weights recorded along with the date of harvest, field replicate, treatment, sampling station and species code.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In Treatment 5 (poplar plantation) biomass estimates are derived from measurements of basal diameter using an allometric relationship between diameter and biomass determined from a subset of trees harvested prior to leaf drop. In the DF (deciduous forest) and CF (conifer forest) wood annual growth is estimated by changes in stem diameter using an allometric equation available in Tritton and Hornbeck (1982). Leaf production in sites with trees is estimated with two 0.8 x 1.2 m litter traps placed on the forest floor of each site.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Details for the ANPP estimates for all treatments are provided below.\r\n\

    Corn / Soybean / Wheat rotation.\r\n\
    h4. Crop\r\n\
    \r\n\
    plants are hand harvested using a 1 m 2 quadrat (see Table 1) at each of the five sampling stations at physiological maturity of the crop:\r\n\
    \r\n    * Corn : black layer (early September).\r\n    * Soybeans : pre-leaf drop (early September).\r\n    * Wheat: kernel entering dough stage (mid-July).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Plant tissue is dried and the total biomass of the plot is recorded. The tissue is then threshed (Almaco corn or small grain thresher) to separate the seed from stover. Seed biomass is recorded and moisture sub samples are taken using a Burrows Digital Moisture Computer 700. Seed and stover tissue sub samples are collected, combined by tissue type over stations, and archived for further analysis.\r\n\
    \r\n    * Calculate the mean total, seed and stover biomass per plot on a dry weight basis.\r\n    * Report for ANPP: mean total biomass (g/m2 /y) and standard error (SE) with n=6 reps (blocks).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Non dominant plant biomass\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Plants are hand harvested using a 1 m 2 quadrat at each of the five sampling stations at physiological maturity of the non dominant plant biomass community. Since this treatment is plowed annually each spring, the dominant non dominant plant biomass have a summer annual life history and mature (set seed) in mid-August. Botanical separations are performed by species by station, dried, and the dry biomass for each species at each station is obtained.\r\n\
    \r\n    * Calculate the sum of the total non dominant plant biomass (over species) at each station; calculate the mean total non dominant plant biomass per plot.\r\n    * Report for ANPP : mean total non dominant plant biomass (g/m2/y), SE, with n=6 reps (blocks).\r\n\

    Identical to Treatment 1 in harvest methods. The majority of non dominant plant biomass in the no till system have perennial life histories and mature at a variety of times, with most maturing in the late summer (mid-August). The few winter annual and biennial non dominant plant biomass that are present in the spring are killed/suppressed with a preplant treatment of glyphosate and are not harvested prior to herbicide application.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    plants are hand harvested using a 1 m 2 quadrat at each of the five sampling stations just prior to plowing and planting of the annual crop. The LC has often not reached physiological maturity by this time (typically mid- to late-May). Non dominant plant biomass is separated from LC for separate analysis (below).\r\n\

    Populus Plantation. Poplar trees with grass cover crop\r\n\
    h4. Crop\r\n\
    \r\n\
    poplar woody biomass has been estimated using a regression equation developed from a destructive harvest each fall prior to fall leaf drop. Historically basal tree diameter squared has been the best predictor of total tree biomass.\r\n\
    \r\n    * Allometric measures of basal tree diameter (mm) at 15 cm above the soil surface are taken in late August . The measurements are made on a subset of 28 flagged trees near sample station 3 (a four row by seven tree matrix) in the 2 x 1 m density plots . Data for rep, tree #, diameter (mm) are entered into a poplar allometric spreadsheet. A histogram of tree diameter is generated to establish the range of diameters and to develop size classes used in the destructive harvest to follow. The regression equation developed in the destructive harvest is used in conjunction with the diameter measures to estimate the biomass of each of the 28 flagged trees per plot.\r\n\
    \r\n    * To develop the regression equation, we annually harvest 12 trees chosen to encompass a proportional representation of trees in each diameter size class. Trees are harvested from all plots but rep 3, which had poor initial stand establishment . Trees are cut at 10 cm above the ground. Measurements include the dry weight of leaves, branches, and trunk separately; basal diameter (mm), total tree height (m), and leader height for each year's growth.\r\n\
    \r\n    * Separate regressions are developed to relate tree height, tree diameter, and basal area to total tree mass and to woody tree mass (branches and stems only).\r\n\
    \r\n    * Mean woody tree biomass (kg/tree) is converted to mean woody areal extent on the basis of 0.5 trees per m 2 .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The 2 x 1m density trees are a matrix of 86 trees (EW) by 27 trees (NS) within a 88.3 by 53.2 m area = 2322 trees/ 4697.56 m 2 = 0.49 trees/m 2\r\n\
    \r\n    * Calculate woody growth increment: The difference of the mean woody tree biomass between successive growing seasons (g/m 2 /y) for each plot\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Regression Equations for Estimated Woody Biomass\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The following predictive equations for poplar woody or total biomass have been generated using the destructive harvest technique. Reported are equations pertaining to the main site 2 x 1 m spacing, however equations specific to tree density spacings and non dominant plant biomass/non dominant plant biomass free growth may be available from the investigating lab for that season. Diameter is measured as mm from 15 cm from the ground unless specified otherwise. Trees were planted as 25 cm cuttings in 1989.\r\n\

    Poplar leaves drop throughout the growing season. Leaf litter is collected in 0.8 x 1.2 m wooden litter trap frames (size was designed to fit within or between poplar rows ) . Two traps are placed in each plot following leaf emergence in late May. Leaves within the traps are collected throughout the season, dried, weighed, and archived for tissue analysis.\r\n\

(Litter traps [above] are placed on the harvested area). Botanical separations are not performed since the grass is essentially a monoculture, however a large majority of the collected grass is standing litter and not fresh tissue.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Non dominant plant biomass in the poplar understory were most prevalent before the establishment of the grass cover crop (fall 1990); there are very few species now. A separate harvest has not been taken for non dominant plant biomass since 1992 . Prior to 1993, non dominant plant biomass was assessed as for Treatment 1. The non dominant plant biomass community in the 2 x 1 m density micro plots without fescue, contains a number of perennial species including Trifolium and Hypericum sp.\r\n\

    Plants are hand harvested using a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat at each of the five sampling stations. A reduced harvest area is used due to the limited size of the plots. The dominant plants have primarily perennial life histories and mature over a range of the summer months. Cool season grasses (e.g. Bromus sp.) and late season perennials (e.g. Solidago sp.) are dominants, and a harvest in mid July allows for reasonable assessment of both types of communities. Botanical separations are performed by species by station, dried, and the dry biomass for each species at each station is obtained.\r\n\

    Annual growth is estimated by changes in stem diameter for all trees within a 20 x 20 in area within each of the three DF stands. Stem diameters are measured in the fall with spring dendrometers (Cattelino et. al., 1986) permanently attached at breast height to all trees beginning in 1995 . Diameters are used to estimate individual tree mass based on allometric equations available in Tritton and Hornbeck (1982): DBH (diameter at breast height) tapes are also used in the spring and fall on all trees within the 400 m 2 plot area.\r\n\

    h2. Procedure\r\n\
    \r\n\
    #  Identifying the lysimeter location.\r\n\
    ## Either choose an appropriate spot arbitrarily or use a suitable randomization technique, such as blind toss of a marker. It may be necessary to adjust location in consideration of traffic, field operations, etc.\r\n\
    # Digging\r\n\
    ##  Lay the tarp or plywood next to where you will be digging.\r\n\
    ## Set the auger at an angle above 45\xC2\xB0 , e.g. 60\xC2\xB0 or so. Start turning.\r\n\
    ## Take the soil you are removing and carefully place it on the tarp or plywood, keeping the horizons separate.\r\n\
    ## Dig until you are 5-10 cm into the C horizon. You should be able to tell by the texture. The soil will become almost pure sand, right after the clayey B horizon.\r\n\
    ##  Remove auger and place pipe down into hole, centering it.\r\n\
    ## Pound pipe until it has deepened the hole by 15 to 20 cm or so.\r\n\
    ##  Remove pipe carefully, retaining the soil in its core. Note that the hole should be smaller in diameter than that made by the auger.\r\n\
    ##  Bang pipe or use stick to clear out soil.\r\n\
    ##  Arrange pipe so that it is sticking in the hole again.\r\n\
    ## Prepare the lysimeter either now or while you are digging.\r\n\
    #  Preparing the lysimeter\r\n\
    ##  Attach a deterioration-resistant string securely to the lysimeter, for retrieval\r\n\
    ##  Unscrew the nut on the lysimeter, taking care not to lose the ferrules. Push tubing through back piece (tubing longer than that supplied will likely be necessary). This may take considerable effort: twisting with pliers may help.\r\n\
    ## Cut the end of the tubing off at an angle. This is important because otherwise the tubing can suction itself against the wall of the lysimeter, which blocks passage of water. (It also removes any tubing damaged with pliers.)\r\n\
    ## Screw the nut back onto the lysimeter, making sure that the ferrules are in place and that the tubing sticks out into the lumen of the lysimeter, but is not pressed all the way into the tip.\r\n\
    ## Then take some deionized water into the syringe and attach syringe to tubing on opposite end of lysimeter.\r\n\
    ## Squeeze the water into the lysimeter to force all the air out. Squeeze water into it until it flushes uniformly. The lysimeter is now ready to be installed. Make sure that you have enough tubing to reach from the lysimeter out to the alleyway.\r\n\
    # Preparing the hole and inserting the lysimeter\r\n\
    ##  Mix a trowel-full of silica flour with enough deionized water to make a slurry about the consistency of a malt.\r\n\
    ## Stir the slurry well and then pour down the pipe.\r\n\
    ## Send the lysimeter after, point first.\r\n\
    ## Carefully remove the pipe, jiggling it slightly to settle the lysimeter into the silica flour.\r\n\
    # Closing up\r\n\
    ## Carefully pack the soil back into the hole in the order that it came out, being careful to keep horizons separate and to pack the soil down as tightly as possible. Some sort of tamper can be helpful.\r\n\
    ## Mark the spot with a flag.\r\n\
    # Setting up the enclosure.\r\n\
    ## Select an appropriate access enclosure. It must be able to fit the Erlenmeyer flasks. Plastic picnic coolers tend to deteriorate after a few years. Conduit junction boxes work well.\r\n\
    ##  In the lab (if possible) drill holes in the enclosure of choice. Use a bit size that creates a hole through which the tubing fits relatively tightly.\r\n\
    ##  Note: if the enclosure must be located some distance from the installed lysimeter, use longer tubing and install it safely below plow depth using a power trenching tool, such as the Ditch Witch 100SX (www.ditchwitch.com).\r\n\
    ##  Fit tubing through the hole in the back of the cooler.\r\n\
    ## Fit tubing through the rubber stopper, again using pliers if you need to and clipping off the mangled end.\r\n\
    ## The rubber stopper must have a second tube going through it. This is what you use to create the suction on the system. You fit the stopper into the flask, attach your pump to the second tube, and pump it out. After you finish, you clamp off the second tube, using a large binder clip.\r\n"

    h3. Overview
    
    Microbial transformations of organic N to ammonium is designated ammonification; while the bacterial conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate is called nitrification. The sum of these processes is N- mineralization. N-mineralization and nitrification are measured by estimated changes in accumulated and in situ nitrogen pool sizes, the difference equalling the assumed net mineralization potential. Two methods of estimatimg N-mineralization and nitrification are used: a short-term buried bag (in field) incubation that accounts for the daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and a long-term incubation that assesses soil organic matter quality with respect to mineralizable N.
    
    Soils collected for short-term N mineralization experiments(incubated in field) are seived, composited and then divided into threesubsamples. The first subsample (designated T0) is analysed immediately for moisture and inorganic NH4+ and NO3-. The other two bags are incubated in the field for 21 days (T21) and designated A and B. This is done for all plots. The bags are incubated in their respective plots. These bags are then collected after an in field incubation of 21 days. The soil samples in both bag A and bag B of each plot are composited and analyzed for moisture andinorganic NH4+ and NO3-.

  abstract: |
    <p>Precipitation is measured using a Belfort Weighing Bucket Preciptiation Gauge.  Staff checks the gauge weekly, changing the chart and emptying the bucket as necessary.  During the winter, antifreeze (ethylene glycol solution) is added to the bucket, which serves to melt snow and protect the bucket.  The paper chart is changed weekly, and read by staff in units of 1/20th of one inch. Database algorythms convert readings to mm.  A date is midnight to midnight local time, either Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time.  During the visit to the station, other sensors are inspected.

    LTER Weather Station Maintenance
    
    6-10-2002. Tim Bergsma. A maintenance routine for the LTER weather station has become institutionalized, but has not been thoroughly documented. In 1997 a weighing bucket rain gauge was installed at the station, eventually replacing the tipping bucket rain gauge. The design of the new gauge requires weekly maintenance visits; some method loosely corresponding to the protocol below has been employed since then. Details vary. For instance, copies of the removed charts were made and stored, from 7-29-97 until 10-15-2001. I am no longer maintaining copies. No regular log has been kept: I am institutionalizing the log today. Details of the operation of the weather station since its initial deployment exist in a variety of forms, and should be available elsewhere. My purpose here is to create a protocol for weather station maintenance that corresponds to current practice. Those maintaining the station should document whether this or some other protocol was employed, noting significant deviations, if any.
    
    Frequency: weekly (usually Monday, as per labeling of precipitation chart)
    
    h3. Materials
    
    # Belfort Instrument Company: Chart No. 5-4046-B, normally stored in data manager's office.
    #  special ink. Contact Belfort for more information. Dropper bottle stored at the instrument.
    #  pencil
    #  soft cloth
    #  spare chart drum
    #  antifreeze, appropriate containment equipment (funnels, waste containers, etc).
    #  Belfort manual. Currently in folder Weath. Inst. Doc, maintained by the LTER data manager, lter.data.manager@kbs.msu.edu.
    # grass clippers
    #  Roundup (glyphosate)
    
    h3. Procedure
    
    # Label a new chart with station, date, expected time of deployment (optional) and your initials.
    # Fold the labeled tab under, and mount on spare drum. Tail of chart overlaps clip such that pen won't snag if it passes the clip.
    #  Proceed to weather station. Visually inspect tower, sensors.
    #  Climb tower to examine two light sensors at 3m. Wipe sensing surfaces with a soft cloth if necessary.
    #  Inspect rain gauge and open the access door.
    # "Ship" the pen and remove the current drum (becomes the spare).
    #  Write in pencil directly on the removed chart: OFF [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].
    #  Store the chart/drum for transport.
    #  Wind the clock fully (but gently), about 24 strokes.
    #  Label the new chart, ON, [date], [time], [time zone], [initials].
    #  Place the new drum, seated fully.
    #  Add ink to the pen as necessary.
    # Remove the collection cylinder if necessary for the following.
    #  Install or remove the collection funnel as necessary. Should not be in place if there is risk of snow.
    #  Empty bucket if necessary. Rain water can be dumped locally. If antifreeze is present, dispose properly.
    #  Add/remove antifreeze as necessary. Add if collected precip. is at risk of freezing, remove when diluted to ineffectiveness by precipitation.
    #  Replace bucket and collection cylinder as necessary.
    # Place pen against chart, while setting the time. Set the time by rotating the drum counter-clockwise only (avoids hysteresis error).
    #  Start the ink flowing by prodding with a pointed object, if necessary.
    #  Close the access door.
    #  Ensure that plants are not growing in the bare soil reserve (east half of fenced area). Spray with Roundup if necessary.
    #  Ensure that plants are not excessively tall in the vegetated soil reserve (west half of fenced area). Clip if necessary, to maintain canopy between 10 and 20 cm.
    #  Write and submit a log entry, stipulating which maintenance tasks were performed. Submit directly or by email to lter.data.manager@kbs.msu.edu.
    #  Submit chart for processing.

  body: "h2. Overview\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Soil and Plant Total C and N Analysis: Carlo Erba NA1500 SeriesII\r\n\
    Sample Preparation\r\n\
    #  All sample material must be dried and ground to a fine powder. For soils, the dried soil could be ground using a roller bar shaker or ground on the EPA grinder in the greenhouse. Plant tissue should be run first through the Wiley Mill and then passed through the Cyclotec grinder. In addition, the micromill may be used to even further pulverize samples that are extremely small in quantity or contain large (>2 mm) pieces of tissue following Cyclotech grinding.\r\n\
    #  Each CN run must begin with a tin foil blank cup (sample #1) and four acetanilide standards (samples 2 thru 5). The 1st standard should weigh about 0.2 to 0.3 mg, the 2nd standard should weigh about 0.5 to 0.6 mg, the 3rd standard should weigh about 1.0 to 1.2 mg, and the 4th standard should weigh about 2.0 to 2.8 mg. Sample #6 should be a blind standard of either soil or plant, depending on the type of samples on the run. It is important to check the printout value of this sample to ensure that the standard curve was properly set. If the values for C & N are off for this blind standard, the run should be stopped. We are attempting to initiate a new standard using the NIST tissue of citrus leaves or tomato leaves, however, the N content is not certified and the carbon value is not available from NIST.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is recommended to run blind standards (the \"soil standard\" or an NIST compound) a minimum of every 15 samples to ensure confidence in the analysis. The soil standards are O519 and O559 (provided by USDA-ARS Pendleton OR) or an LTER-recommended soil NIST standard. The plant standard compounds include citrus leaves, pine needles and tomato leaves.\r\n\
    To Weigh a Sample or Standard\r\n\
    \r\n\
    #  Turn on the Sartorius scale if the display is not lit., press tare to bring display to 0.00 mg. It is recommended that you wear gloves while weighing samples.\r\n\
    # Place an empty tin foil cup on the weighing tray and close the doors.\r\n\
    # Tare off the weight of the cup using the tare button.\r\n\
    #  Remove the cup and fill with ~ 1 spoon of tissue.\r\n\
    # Crunch the cup using two sets of tweezers. Once completely closed into a ball formation, drop onto the weighing plate to ensure no sample leaks out. If the sample is leaky, discard the ball and begin again.\r\n\
    #  Place the closed cup onto the weighing pan and record the weight (in mg) on the provided datasheet.\r\n\
    #  Gently remove the sample and place into the plexiglass sample holding trays.\r\n\
    #  Bring the scale display back to 0.00 mg by pressing tare.\r\n\
    #  Using KIM wipes, clean the tweezers, the spoon, and the metal plate between each sample.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The key to the samples is a consistent weight . Soil samples should weigh between 10.0 to 15.0 mg, and plant samples from 4 to 6 mg. The Sartorius scale can't provide an accurate weight under 0.2 mg. Plexiglass plates should be stored in a vacuum desiccator until analyzed.\r\n\
    Total C and N Analysis\r\n\
    \r\n\
    WARNING: NEVER try to use the computer while a CN run is in progress!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Basically, the computer is used mainly as an integrator and to advance the auto sampler. Although run conditions are recorded in the methods file, all run conditions must be manually checked prior to starting a run. Each run can contain a maximum of 99 samples, including the blinds, blanks, and standards. Complete runs are stored as methods (<code>*.ead</code>) and contain the sample table info, chromatograms and run parameters. Stored files contain individual chromatograms (<code>*.dat</code>). The data should also be written to a summary file (<code>*.sum</code>) which may be downloaded to the VAX and run through SAS jobs to avoid any manual data entry of the results.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The return button on the mouse is the left button. Pressing the right button will bring up HELP during any application.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If the Eager software window is not showing, hit the space bar to inactivate the screen saver. If Windows95 desktop is showing, click the start button and restart in DOS mode. From the C:>WIN type cd\\ and then C:> cd EAGER200 . At C:\\EAGER200> EAGER. The program will boot up. User should respond YES to delete scratch files.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If the Eager software window is not showing and the screen display is a chromatogram, mouse over to the = (three lines symbol) and quit view monitor .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At the Eager software window, first load method for the appropriate template for the tissue you are working with. The template contains the correct run information for the integration parameters. Subdirectories have been established for the different investigators within the main directory EAGCHA . For example, Dr. Gross's work is stored under the directory EAGCHA\\KGROSS with subdirectories after the investigator directories. If you need to create a new directory for your samples, exit the eager software to DOS and create the directory. You will need to copy the SOIL.ead or PLANT.ead template into your new directory. To do this, start in root directory, and type: copy_soil.ead_(or plant.ead) c:\\new directory name . If this is your first time doing this, please ask for assistance. Some of the current directories are (referred to as disk and directory in the LOAD option):\r\n\
    \r\n\
    EAGCHA\\GPR\\SOIL\r\n\
    \r\n\
    EAGCHA\\GPR\\PLANT\r\n\
    \r\n\
    EAGCHA\\KGROSS\\\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Once you are in the directory you want, for soils, load SOIL.ead ; for plants load PLANT.ead .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bring up the Method card and change the template name ( soil.ead or plant.ead ) to the new file name (ie.L90corn.ead). Your file name should have a maximum of 8 characters, start with a letter, and be followed by the .ead suffix. It should reflect as much as possible the year, experiment, and tissue type. After you name the file, SAVE it to the correct directory.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    *Changes in sample table editing ; Eager Software Version 3.12 and higher*\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sample table data can be entered using a spreadsheet (Cntemplate.xls) and then imported directly into the sample table. The spreadsheet format is shown below, followed by the resulting *imp file that is imported into the EAGER software. The resulting file must be saved as comma delimited with a <code>*.imp</code> filename format. If using Excel to create the spreadsheet, use the save as option, select comma delimited (<code>*.csv</code>) and put the filename as \"file.imp\". The quotation marks are necessary to override the default .csv extension. Unfortunately, Excel seems to put in some tailing comma's so pull the <code>*.imp</code> file into a word processor (Notepad, Word, etc.) to clean up any tailing commas. The tailing comma following the blank on the first line is necessary to import the file correctly.\r\n\

    Bring up the Sample Table Card and import data from disk . The template should have the generic file and sample name codes, these must be replaced to identify the specific samples to be run. Choose the correct drive (3.5\" floppy is B:/ ) and select the filename. The program imports the data directly. Check for errors and use the mouse or tab key to toggle between squares in the table. In the case of type and standard type , click the mouse within the box to reveal the appropriate choices ( blank , standard , or unknown ).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The 1st column in the sample table is for samplename and start with a letter- no punctuation (punctuation won't go thru SAS). All of the replicate cups of each sample should have the same Samplename , and then the filename (2nd column of table) can be the same as the samplename with the suffix a , b , c , d , etc. (a different one for each cup). This will enable the *.sum files to be easily processed thru SAS. Each individual sample chromatogram will be saved under that filename specified in the sample table. Standard filenames should be sequential (ie. std5 , std6 , std7 ) in both samplename and filename boxes. Samplenames may be descriptive and reflect the experiment, year, and type of tissue as much as possible. Filenames are limited to 5 digits (ie.LTER 1990 corn grain plot 1-3 = CG13 ) = CG13a . The filename extension of *.dat will be automatically added in memory. Fill in sample 1 as a blank, specifying type as blank, and do not enter in a weight. Samples 2 through 5 are standards and should be identified as type = standard and standard type = acetanilide or phenacetin ; enter the weight.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Note: filenames (<code>*.dat</code>) are limited to 5 characters max and will be truncated if longer. The last of the 5 char is the analytical rep.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sample root should be descriptive (ie: CG ) and file root same (CG), type = UNK. The number of samples should reflect the remaining number of samples (ie if 99 total samples, 94 samples remain). The blind standards should have the samplename : blind std___(whatever it is); all the blind standards should have the same samplename so SAS will integrate the values; and the blind standard filename should be an abbreviation and a , b , c , d , etc. For example, if analyzing soil, you could call the samplename: blind std 519 , and the filenames in that run: O519a , O519b , O519c , etc. Use next page to continue at the end of the chart. When finished, always UPDATE , and SAVE at the software window under the new method file name to the correct disk and directory name (ie: EAGCHA\\GPR\\SOIL L90corn.ead ). Say Yes when asked if want to overwrite. Be sure you are SAVING to the correct file and directory before you overwrite, to make sure you don't overwrite a previous set of samples or someone else's data!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The template card called CALCULATION AND REPORT PARAMETERS should be set to the specifications as shown below (only visible in hard copy version) in the printout of that table: (It is very important that these be set correctly, especially the APPEND TO SUMMARY: YES option).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Once saved, print out the sample table to double check the entered weights with those hand-recorded on the datasheet. Also carefully check that each sample has a distinct filename .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Running Samples\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Load samples into the autosampler wheel,wearing gloves and using tweezers. The wheel can be turned clockwise to bring 1 back over deeply recessed hole so the blank (sample #1 on the datasheet and sample table) will go into the deeply recessed hole. Load in the remaining samples to #0 in a counterclockwise direction. If you have greater than 50 samples, put the top wheel on top of the bottom wheel (can only go on one way due to post and hole sizes) and load #51-#99 in the top wheel (also counterclockwise). The metal rod on the top wheel should be between #50 & #51 and to the left of the metal rod on the bottom wheel. Set the gray plastic cover on top of the wheel.\r\n\
    \r\n\

    If everything looks good up to here, mouse over to RUN on the software page and Start Analysis . You may also choose to Monitor Dectector at this time.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Watch the first six samples closely. Blank areas for Carbon should ideally be <3500 units. Sample #6, your first blind standard , should be within the correct amounts for Carbon and Nitrogen for that sample. If these are within the range, continue to let the run proceed. If not, mouse to RUN and Stop at end of sample . If any problems develop during the run, mouse to RUN and Stop at end of sample . This may be done from either the Monitor Detector screen or the Blue software screen.\r\n\
    \r\n After Run is Completed:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Turn Flow and Purge switches to ST BY and OFF; and push furnace buttons to standby (in).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. LTER Data Post-Processing\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Chromatogram files are stored in a <code>*.sum</code> file within the proper directory for the user group. To download to a floppy disk, place the disk in the B: drive and at the eager software window pull down on the = (3 line symbol) to file organizer . At the file organizer window, select the copy file option. On the copy file line type in the correct file with the .sum suffix. Confirm , and copy the correct <code>*.sum</code> file to the B:\\ (NOT the C:\\).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Download the <code>*.sum</code> file to the VAX directories.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The <code>*.sum</code> file is a long linear file with each sample and its corresponding information written to separate lines. It is not readily imported into a spreadsheet program in this form. Use the CNDOWN.sas program (in the directories below) to transform the *.sum file into a file\r\n\
    \r\n\
    with 5 columns of usable data.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    LTER files should then be transferred to:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    for soils: group63d:[generald.lter.baseline.chn.chnsoil]\r\n\
    \r\n\
    for plants: group63d:[generald.lter.baseline.chn.ltercrop]\r\n\
    \r\n\
    File transfer continues to evolve. At this time (1998) I use a PC running WIN95, Windows Explorer, and under Tools : Map Network Drive. Establish the 63d drive above as the remote drive and drag and drop the <code>*.sum</code> file from the floppy to the targeted VAX drive.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Meanwhile, Back in the Lab, on the VAX:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    # Log onto the VAX\r\n\
    #  Go to the target directory & subdirectories, based on where you send the <code>*.sum</code> file.\r\n\

  description: ""
  abstract: The O.I. Analytical Flow Solution IV analyzer is an automated continuous-flow colorimetric analyzer used for the analysis of NO<sub>3</sub>^- , NO<sub>2</sub>^- , NH<sub>4</sub>^+ , and PO<sub>4</sub>^= in soil extracts and water samples . Our configuration consists of the RA Sampler (X-Y-Z random access autosampler), Model 502 pump, Expanded Range (ER) Detector, and ALPKEM WinFLOW V4 software.

  body: "Start-up:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    # Remove reagents, wash solution, and stock standards from refrigerator and allow to them come to room temperature.\r\n\
    # Turn on main power switch on front of Flow Solution IV Powerbase.\r\n\
    # Inspect tubing at pump site for failure.\r\n\
    # Inspect plumbing for proper connections.\r\n\
    # Open valve on nitrogen gas pillow.\r\n\
    # Clamp platens down on pump, pull platen levers up to apply pressure to tubes and start pump.  Normal operating speed and direction is \xE2\x80\x9340.00.\r\n\
    # Immerse wash pump tube in nanopure water (~1L).\r\n\
    # Attach all other reagent pump tubing to wash bucket containing nanopure water (with 1mL Brij 35 (30%)/ 1L).\r\n\
    # Liquid should be observed moving through all appropriate tubes. If movement is not observed check for improper connection, possible faulty tube or blockage in tube, sample probe or cartridge. \r\n\
    # Open WinFLOW program and start data collection while pumping water through system.  Allow water to flow through system until it stabilizes with a regular bubble pattern. While waiting, prepare reagent bottles, standards, and sample table(s). \r\n\
    # Connect reagents and wash with appropriate pump tubes and wait for baseline to stabilize. Continue by aligning samples with the sample run sequence table and with any other preparations for the run. Make sure there are no bubbles trapped in the detector flow cells.\r\n\
    # If nitrate is being run, now is the time to attach the cadmium coil. Make sure there is minimal oxygen (ambient air) being introduced through lines. With pump on minimum speed (-5.00) insert coil between ports two and ten, on the cartridge. Then set pump speed back to normal and allow bubbles to stabilize. After the cadmium coil is connected and the bubbles are acceptable, check the coil efficiency and peak repeatability by sampling working nitrate and nitrite standards of equal concentrations (usually 8ppm).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h2. Shutdown:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    # If nitrate is being run, disconnect cadmium-reducing coil by first setting the pump speed at \xE2\x80\x935.00. Then disconnect coil between cartridge ports two and ten (be careful not to introduce oxygen or ambient air into coil) after re-connecting ports two and ten, return pump speed to normal.\r\n\
    # Take all reagent lines off reagents and put them on nanopure water (with 1 mL Brij 35 (30%)/ 1L) allow the system to rinse thoroughly (about 10-20 minutes depending on chemistries being used). If KCl is used for wash, wash line must be rinsed with water also (no Brij).\r\n\
    # After the system has been rinsed disconnect all input lines (including the wash line).\r\n\
    # Shut off the pump and release platen levers and platens. Do NOT leave tension on pump tubing with pump off, this will ruin the tubing.\r\n\
    # Turn off the main power switch.\r\n\
    # Close valve on nitrogen pillow.\r\n\
    # Dispose of all waste by-products promptly and correctly: \r\n\
    ## Dispose of ammonia waste and contaminated ammonia reagents in labeled hazardous waste container in the hood.\r\n\
    ## Dispose of nitrate waste by neutralizing pH with 10N NaOH then dump down drain with lots of water. Watch for color change from pink to peach/orange.\r\n\
    ## Dispose of contaminated solids (paper towels etc.) appropriately.\r\n\
    IF IN DOUBT ABOUT DISPOSAL: ASK! \r\n\
    ## If waste and/or reagents cannot be disposed of LABEL CLEARLY and leave in hood.\r\n\
    # Rinse cadmium coil with 10mL barnstead water (no Brij) and store with water in. Use a luer lock connector and syringe. Be careful not to introduce air into the coil.\r\n\
    # Store all reagents, standards and samples appropriately.\r\n\
    # Leave work area in neat and clean condition-appropriate for others to work in common courtesy and the Golden Rule. \r\n"

    h2. KBS LTER GPS Protocol
    
    h3. Materials
    
    h4. Hardware
    
    The KBS LTER has two identical Trimble GPS units. "GPS I" is to be used exclusively by the KBS LTER staff. "GPS II" can be loaned to others with permission by the LTER Project Manager.
    
    Two components make up each GPS unit: the Trimble Data logger type TSCe with touch screen, and the Trimble Receiver Type Pro XRS model 33302-51.
    
    The GPS can be used in temperatures from -4 F to 140 F. The logger is designed to withstand accidental immersion so it should be fine to use it in the rain.
    
    The data logger is set to power off after 10 minutes of inactivity to conserve the batteries.
    
    Start, Settings, Control Panel, Power Off tab, "On Batteries suspend after: 10 minutes"
    
    h4. Software
    
    # TerraSync - Used for collecting and updating GPS data on the Trimble data logger.
    # Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office (Version 2.9)- Used to manage and process GPS data on the PC.
    # Microsoft Active Sync 3.1.0.9558 - Used to connect your PC to the Trimble Data Logger in order to transfer data.
    # Omnistar is a GPS service that gives real-time differential correction. The Omnistar service will be maintained on "LTER GPS I", if funding allows. Omnistar service will not be purchased for LTER GPS II unless another user requests to borrow the unit and pays for the Omnistar service. See the Appendix for service details.
    
    h4. Set Up
    
    GPS Mission Planning
    
    GPS mission planning allows you to determine what time of day the satellites are in suboptimum position so that you can avoid collecting GPS data during these times. Mission planning is critical when collecting GPS data in forested areas or other challenging sites (see "Collecting Data in Trees or near Obstructions" in the Appendix).
    
    # The Planning Software should be installed on the two computer's in the Robertson Lab that have Trimble's GPS Pathfinder Office software, however, if it is not installed then do the following.
    ## Go to "Trimble website":http://www.trimble.com.
    ## Click on: "Support and Training"
    ## Scroll down and click on: "Planning Software"
    ## Click on: "Downloads"
    ## Download: Trimble Planning Software
    # Update the ephemeris file if it has been more than one week since it was last updated.
    ## Go to Trimble website: http://www.trimble.com
    ## Click on: "Support and Training"
    ## Scroll to and click on: "Planning Software"
    ## Click on: "Downloads"
    ## Download: "Ephemeris File" Save it to D:\Program Files\Common Files\Trimble\Almanacs\current.ssf.
    # Open GPS Pathfinder Office.
    # If the "Select Project" window appears, deselect "Display this dialog at start-up".
    # Click "Utilities" on the Tool Bar.
    # Scroll down to "Quick Plan".
    # "Select Date" window appears. Choose the date of interest, and click OK.
    # "Edit Point" window appears.
    #  Choose "City" and select Battle Creek, MI
    # The Status window opens.
    ## Choose "Options" on the Tool Bar and scroll to "Elevation Mask", enter 10 degrees.
    # To view the PDOP status
    ## Click "Graphs" on the Tool Bar, and scroll down to PDOP. A graph of PDOP over time will be displayed. You should plan to do your GPS data collection when the PDOP is equal or less than 4 if possible. See the "Understanding PDOP" section in the Appendix for an explanation of PDOP.
    
    h4. Data Dictionary
    
    A data dictionary is used in the field to control the collection of features and attributes. It prompts you to enter information or select from a menu of choices to ensure that the data collected is complete, accurate, and compatible with the LTER database and GIS.
    
    # A data dictionary called 'KBS LTER already exists and should be loaded on both data loggers.
    # If you are collecting GPS locations for a feature that is not already defined in the data dictionary, you will need to add your feature to a data dictionary so that the appropriate attributes are collected for the LTER database.
    ##  If it is a main feature on the LTER then add it to the KBS LTER data dictionary, otherwise create your own data dictionary. Do not edit the "KBS LTER" data dictionary without permission from the LTER Project Manager or GIS Manager.
    ## See "Making and Editing a Data Dictionary" in the Appendix if you need to edit the data dictionary or create a new one.
    
    h4. Transferring Files to GPS Data Logger
    
    You may need to transfer files from your computer to the data logger, such as files to be edited, files to be used for navigation, or a new or edited data dictionary.
    
    # Log yourself onto the computer that has Pathfinder Office installed on it. If you do the following step before logging in then you will get an error message.
    # Connect the data logger to your computer using the nine-pin connector cable.
    # Microsoft ActiveSync software will open automatically and will establish a link between your PC and the GPS data logger.
    # (You may get the message - Microsoft Active Sync does not recognize the device you are trying to connect. Retry.) and/or Would you like to set up a partnership?
    ## Select "No" (you do not want to set up a partnership).
    # The green Microsoft ActiveSync icon will state "connecting" and then "connected".
    # Open GPS Pathfinder Office. If the "Select Project" window appears, deselect "Display this dialog at start-up".
    ## "Utilities"/"data transfer" /select the "send" tab.
    ## Select the "Add" dropdown menu and choose "Data File".
    ## Highlight the desired file(s) and click " Open".
    ## "Transfer All"
    ## You should get a message on the PC - "Transfer Completed". It will tell you how many files were transferred.
    
    h3. Preparing the GPS
    
    # Connect the batteries to the receiver.
    ## A green light on the battery charger indicates that the batteries are charged.
    ## Connect the batteries to the GPS receiver inside the backpack by hooking them to the cable coming from the data receiver; the cable is split in two to connect to two batteries. Use the batteries in the front of the charger first.
    ## Place batteries in the pockets next to the receiver.
    ## Take an extra set if you plan to be out for more than four hours.
    # Connect the data logger to the receiver using the cable with a nine-pin connector on each side. One side of the cable should already be connected to the receiver.
    # Open the TerraSync application by double-clicking on the icon on the data logger touch screen. It may be slow to open if there are lots of files stored on the data logger.
    # Connect the antenna to the receiver using the TerraSync software. This connection needs to be completed in order to verify the battery power of both the receiver.
    ## Select the "Set Up" section button drop down menu in the upper left.
    ## "Connect"
    # When you connect, you should get a small message at the top of the screen- "almanac received". Then the following message will appear to show that your Omnistar service is working and when your subscription needs to be renewed: "Integrated Satellite real-time service Information, User Access- Enabled, End Date-".
    # The battery icon at the top of the screen gives the battery status: the right hand side shows the logger battery charge and the left side shows the charge of the receiver batteries. You can touch the icon for the percent of battery charge available.
    # Non-LTER folks need to sign out GPS II before leaving the lab.
    
    h3. Data Logger Settings
    
    Verify that all your settings are appropriate in the TerraSync Setup. Never change the settings on LTER GPS I. If you change the settings on LTER GPS II, be sure to set them back to the following settings when you return the GPS.
    
    The Section drop-down menu is located in the upper left hand of the logger screen. Select the "Setup" section.

    Collecting Data
    
    # Open TerraSync on the data logger by double-clicking the TerraSync icon (if not already open).
    # If not connected, connect antenna to receiver (see step 5 of "Preparing the GPS").
    # From the "Data" Section menu, a screen appears that prompts you to create a new data file.
    ## Assign the file a name.
    ### The default name is the month-day-hour that you began the file; don't use this name.
    ### Instead, name the file by feature and date, such as lysimeters_20041230, TSF_corners_20051230, or grad_student_name_sites_20031012.
    ## Choose the desired data dictionary. LTER personnel use the "KBS LTER" dictionary except for special projects.
    ## Press "Create"
    ## Select "Options"
    ### To ensure you don't begin to log data right away, select "Log Later".
    ### Verify that the " Logging Interval" is set to use "time" as the Logging Style and a 1 second interval.
    # When using the KBS LTER data dictionary, it will list feature types (such as lysimeter). Select a feature and press "Create". If using a generic data dictionary, that does not have predefined features, select point, line or area and then "Create".
    # Place the antenna directly over the feature and press "Log" (on the right side of the screen) to start collecting GPS data for that feature.
    ## A pencil icon on the top of the screen will wiggle back and forth to indicate that data are being logged or will flash to indicate that data cannot be logged. Each time a point is logged, you will hear a click and the number next to the pencil icon will increase.
    ## Note that data will not be logged if the PDOP is too high or if you do not have a real-time connection since we have set these data quality restrictions on the data logger during setup. For some applications, such as collecting data under trees, you may find that the PDOP setting is too restrictive, see "Understanding PDOP" and "Collecting Data in Trees or near Obstructions" in the Appendix.
    ## Fill out the attributes that are requested on the screen.
    ## Press "Pause" to pause the logging of points. Press OK when you want to stop logging the feature; this will save it.
    ### In order to assure good quality data, it is best to collect 30 points. When using the KBS LTER data dictionary, you must collect 30 positions for each feature or the following message will appear: "Insufficient positions- Do you want to store the feature now?".
    # Repeat step 4 and 5 for each feature.
    # To view the data, go to the "Map" Section menu.
    # To save the file, press "Close" in the upper right hand part of the screen. The data are not saved until you close the file, therefore you should close it occasionally.
    
    h3. Updating a File
    
    Sometimes you may need to work with an existing file and either update the data or collect new features in the file. Before you update a file that has already been sent to the Data Manager, you will to need to get permission from the Project Manager and also discuss this with the Data Manager to let him/her know that you plan to edit data in the database. If the file is not stored on the data logger, you first need to transfer the file from your computer to the GPS data logger (see the "Transferring Files to GPS Data Logger" section).
    
    # Open TerraSync on the data logger.
    # Select the "Data" section button (in the upper left).
    #  "Existing File"
    # Select the file to be updated, press open.
    # To update a feature
    ## "Data"
    ## "Update Features"
    ## "Begin"
    # To collect a new feature
    ## "Data"
    ## "Collect Features"
    ## "Begin"
    
    h3. Navigating
    
    You can use the GPS to navigate to a feature that was GPS'ed at an earlier time.
    
    If the GPS data have already been entered in the KBS LTER database, you must query the database to get the desired data (see "Getting GPS Data out of the Database"), and then create an import file in GPS Pathfinder Office (see "Importing Data") (Do not use the original Pathfinder files since they may be outdated.
    
    If the file is not stored on the data logger, then see "Transfer Files to GPS Data Logger".
    
    # In TerraSync, open the file containing the points to navigate to.
    # Select the "Data" Section button (in the upper left).
    # "Existing File"
    # Select the desired file.
    # "Open"
    # Highlight (touch once) the feature to which you want to navigate to (touching twice will open the update feature dialogue box).
    # "Options" This options menu will only appear after you have opened the file.
    # "Set Nav Target"
    # Select the "Navigation" Section button.
    # You will now see a large circle with an arrow inside. The arrow indicates the direction to which you want to walk to get to the target. When you get to within 5 meters of your target, the screen will change. You will now see a small circle, which is the target, and an "x", which is you. Continue walking in the direction that will move the "x" (your position) into the circle. When the "x" is in the circle, you have reached your target. To the right of this target there are numbers that tell you the actual distance you are from your target.
    
    Definition of words to the right of navigation screen:
    
    # Bearing - the angle to the navigational target relative to north. This angle will change as one moves.
    # Heading - the angle of the direction you are traveling.
    # Turn - the angle you should turn to be on the designated bearing (always clockwise).
    
    To navigate to a station flag along the plot paths:
    
    Walk in a straight line until the bearing states either 0, 90, 180, 270 or 360 (depending on which station you are navigating to and your direction); you are now parallel to a station flag and can now turn right or left.

    h3. LTER Database
    
    When the Trimble data files and export files have been checked, they should be moved to the LTER database. You can query the database to get GPS data needed for navigation or other needs,
    Moving GPS Data into the Database
    
    # You created a dBase (dbf) when you exported your data as a shapefile.
    # Open this dbf file in Excel to verify that the columns are in the following order: Treatment, Replicate, FeatDes, Microplot, Comments, Max_PDOP, Max_HDOP, Corr_Type, Rcvr_Type, GPS_Date, Update_Sta, Feat_Name, Datafile, Unfilt_Pos, Data_Dicti, GPS_Height, Vert_Prec, Horz_Prec, Std_Dev, Northing and then Easting.
    # Save as file type: CSV (Comma delimited).
    # Move the comma delimited files to: LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\ready for database\comma_delimited_files.
    # Move the Trimble files (.ssf) to: \LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\ready for database\ssf_files.
    # Inform the LTER Data Manager that the files are ready for the database.
    # The Data Manager will move the comma-delimited files to the appropriate table in the database. These data will be accessible by querying the database.
    # The Data Manager will move all the original Trimble files (.ssf files) to a storage location; these files will not be stored in the database and can only be accessed by making a special request to the Data Manager.
    # Once the data are in the database, the LTER Data Manager will delete these files from their original location.
    
    h4.Getting GPS Data Out of the Database
    
    Query the KBS LTER database on the web for the desired GPS data.
    
    # Select "KBS039 (GPS data)". If you plan to use the data for navigation then select "KBS039-002 (Navigational GPS Points)" which has only the attributes needed for navigation. If you need more information about the data then select "KBS039-003 (Navigational GPS Points Expanded)".
    # "Missing Value Indicator:" leave blank
    # "Reformat As:" don't select any reformat.
    # Select and copy the desired data
    # Open a blank file in Microsoft Excel.
    ## Paste in the data from the query.
    ## If the data will be used for navigation, Save In: \LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\navigation\.
    ## Give it an appropriate name with the letters NAV_ in front, the feature, and the date the data was exported from the database at the end. Example: NAV_T5_corners_20040530.
    ## If you plan to import these data back into GPS Pathfinder Office for navigation, you must save the file as a dBase file. "Save As Type" DBF 4 (dbase IV) (*.dbf).
    
    h4. Importing Data
    
    You may want to put a data file (from the LTER database or another source) on the GPS logger for navigation. To do this you must import a dBase file back into GPS Pathfinder Office. The file will be saved as an import file (imp).
    
    # Open GPS Pathfinder Office.
    # Select "Utilities" and then "Import"
    # "Selected Files": browse to choose your desired dBase files.
    # "Output Folder": browse to choose the desired output location. LTER files to be used for navigation should be saved in \LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\navigation\

    h3. Appendixes
    
    h4. Understanding PDOP
    
    DOP, dilution of precision, is an indication of the current satellite geometry. A low DOP indicates a higher probability of accuracy.
    The PDOP (position dilution of precision) is perhaps the most important factor in data accuracy. A PDOP of " 4.5 is good. A PDOP of 4.6- 6.0 is poor but usable. A PDOP of "6 is not usable.
    
    We set the PDOP limit on the receiver so that positions are not recorded if the PDOP is above 4; this limit is called the PDOP mask (to set the PDOP mask see Data Logger Settings, GPS settings). Our PDOP mask of 4 is fairly restrictive, to allow us to collect the best data possible. For some applications, such as collecting data under trees, you may find that setting the PDOP mask higher is necessary (see "Collecting Data in Trees or near Obstructions"). In such situations, the PDOP mask could be set to 6, but be aware that the quality of the data that you collect could be inferior. If you do set the PDOP mask higher; record this in your GPS usage log (see "Complete Log of GPS Usage on the LTER Intranet") and be sure to change it back to 4 when finished.
    
    h4. Collecting Data in Trees or near Obstructions
    
    # Collecting data in forested area presents special challenges because the trees can block the satellite reception.
    # If possible, it is very helpful to collect data during the leaf-off period in Fall, Winter or Spring.
    # Mission planning is critical when working in forested areas. Set your criteria such that you have plenty of satellites available (such as ="7) and a high quality PDOP (such as " 3).
    # Be patient! When collecting data in the forest, you may find that you can't collect any data for a few minutes and then the satellites realign and data start coming in.
    # This protocol requires collecting 30 positions per point. However, depending on the accuracy needed for your application, you may need to settle for " 30 positions per point in the forest.
    # This protocol requires setting the PDOP mask to 4 but you may find this too restrictive when collecting data under tree cover. If needed, you can set the PDOP mask to 6, see "Understanding PDOP" above.
    # If you do the above and cannot collect data then you can use an offset point (see "Using an Offset Point to Collect Data" below).
    
    h4 . Making and Editing a Data Dictionary
    
    Before creating a data dictionary, think of the features (physical object or an event) that you will want to collect and the attributes (descriptive information) that you want to record about the feature. Enter only the 5 attributes listed below if the GPS data will be stored in the LTER database.
    
    To create a new data dictionary:
    
    # Open GPS Pathfinder Office
    # "Utilities"
    # "Data Dictionary Editor"
    # "File"
    # "New"
    # "Name": Select a name for the data dictionary.
    # "New Feature"
    ## Select the "Properties" tab
    ### Give the feature a name. You can use word(s) with more than 8 characters but only the first 8 characters will be used in the file name when it is exported.
    ### Select a Feature Classification: point, line, or area. Data to be stored in the database should be collected as a point feature.
    ## Select the "Default Settings" tab
    ### "Logging Interval": time, 1 second for a point
    ### "Minimum positions": 30
    ### "Accuracy": Code
    ## Select the "Symbol" tab
    ### Select the type of symbol and its details.
    # "New attribute"
    ## "New Attribute Type"
    ## Select "Menu", to enter a menu of choices that will allow data to be entered in a consistent manner or
    ## Select the appropriate type of data, such as "numeric" or "text", if you want your GPS operator to enter the attribute information from the keypad.
    ## Select a "name" for the attribute
    ## Field entry: select required on creation, if appropriate, to ensure that the GPS operator does not forget to enter critical information.
    ## GPS data to be stored in the LTER database must have only the following 5 attributes:
    ### Treatment; use "menu" to enter 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,CF,DF,SF.
    ### Replicate; use "menu" to enter 1,2,3,4,5,6.
    ### FeatureDescription; use "menu" to enter the relevant descriptions for the feature. For example: For lysimeters, use "menu" to enter 1,2,3,4,5; For leaf litter traps, use "menu" to enter 1,2,3,N-S, E-W; For microplot corner, use "menu" to enter NW, NE, SE and SW and center.
    ### Microplot; use "text", length 50 characters
    ### Comment; use "text", length 50 characters
    # Save file in LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\data dictionaries.
    
    To edit an existing data dictionary (do not edit the LTER data dictionary without permission):
    
    # Open GPS Pathfinder Office.
    # "Utilities"
    # "Data Dictionary Editor"
    # "File"
    # "Open"
    ## Select an existing data dictionary. KBS LTER is stored in: LTERnt2\LTER\GPS\data dictionaries
    ## Double-click on a feature or attribute to edit it.
    
    To transfer the edited or new dictionary into the data logger, see "Transferring Files to GPS Data Logger".
    
    h4. Using an Offset Point to Collect Data
    
    Sometimes you may not be able to collect good GPS data for a point because the satellites are blocked by trees, buildings, etc. In these situations, you can use the "offset" option in TerraSync and collect the GPS location for a nearby (offset) point, and enter the bearing and distance to the desired point from the offset point that you GPS'ed. The GPS will then give you the coordinates of the desired point.
    
    #  Select an offset point near the desired point that allows you to get a good PDOP. Mark the offset point with a temporary stake if needed. You will get better quality data if the offset is close to the desired point because the bearing measurement error is exaggerated with greater distance.
    # Set up your compass on a tripod over the offset point. Level the compass using the bubble.
    # Measure the distance (in meters) from the offset point to the desired point and record it.
    # Measure the bearing (azimuth), from north as 0-360 degrees, from the offset point to the desired point and record it.
    ## If your compass does not account for declination then you need to add the declination for the KBS area: -5.1 (note the negative sign) to your bearing. Example: If the bearing on a compass without declination correction is 321 degrees + -5.1 degrees for declination correction = 315.9 degrees. If it does account for declination then verify that it is set correctly to 5.1 degrees west (for KBS area).
    # There are 2 compasses available in the KBS storeroom that are okay for the job.
    ## The Keuffel and Esser surveying compass fits onto a tripod and therefore works nicely. Unfortunately the Keuffel and Esser compass does not use 360 degrees but rather is split into four quarters of 90 degrees each. In order to record the bearing from north, locate the arm of the needle that has an arrow inscribed on it (this points to north) and read your angle from that needle as 0-360 degrees not the 0-90 degrees that the compass reads. The first few times that you record bearings with the Keuffel and Esser compass also measure the bearing with another compass to verify that you are reading the Keuffel and Esser compass correctly.
    ## A Suunto, code KB-14/360 R, is also available from the KBS storeroom. This compass allows you to sight through to your point or pole but can be a bit tricky to get a stable reading. There are 2 bearings given on the compass, read the larger number off of the compass since this gives the bearing from your location to the sighted location.

    h3. Troubleshooting
    
    # As mentioned earlier, it is important to disconnect the data logger from the receiver before disconnecting the batteries. However, if the batteries do get disconnected before the data logger, then when you try to reconnect you may get an error box telling you that the com port is already connected and it will not allow you to reconnect. The solution to this problem is a soft reset.
    # A soft reset of the data logger allows you to keep the RAM intact; all data and software will remain intact. To do a soft reset: [Shift] (yellow button with up arrowhead) + {Ctrl} + {On/Off].

  abstract: Soybean has high content of oil and protein, and it is major oil seed as biodiesel resource in US. This protocol is used to measure total oil content and oil compositions in soybean seed. Total oil content is measured by accelerated solution extractor; after in-situ transesterification, oil composition is measured by gas chromatograph (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID) .
  body: "h3. Oil content measurement\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The total oil content measurement followed the method of Matth\xC3\xA4us, B. and Br\xC3\xBChl, L. (2001) \r\n\
    After grinding by Foss water-cooled Knifetec 1095 sample mill (Tecator AB, H\xC3\xB6gan\xC3\xA4s, Sweden) for 10 s, about 1.0 g of powdered sample was weighted for total oil extraction by accelerated solvent extractor ASE 200 (Dionex, Idstein, Germany) with 11 mL stainless-steel extractor cell. The dead volume of the extractor cell was filled with Ottawa sand (Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY). The following conditions were set on the ASE system: preheat for 6 min, heat for 6 min, oven temperature at 105 oC, static time for 10 min, flush volume 70%, purge time for 60s, 2 static cycles, and extraction pressure at 1000 psi. After process, extraction solvent hexane was evaporated by purging oxygen free compressed nitrogen (AGA Gas, location) above the surface. The residue hexane was removed in oven at 100 <super>o</super>C for about 70 min. The total oil content is calculated by the equation as follow (ref AOCS):\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %C = 100 x Qw / (W x (1- moisture%))\r\n\
    \r\n\
    in which Ow (g) is the total oil extracted from ground sample, W (g) is the weight of ground sample, and moisture% is the moisture percentage of the ground sample measured by by A & D Moisture analyzer \r\n\

Macroinvertebrates will be collected with a 7.6 cm diameter soil corerdriven gently by hand to a depth of 20 cm.  One core is taken at each of the 5 soil sampling stations per plot and all 5 cores are composited as one soil sample.

Macroinvertebrates are recovered from soil cores within 48 h of collection by elutriation.  The soil-root washer (Gilson Hydropneumatic Elutriator) is utilized to suspend soil subsamples in a vortex of water and compressed air which floats off soil and suspended organics.  Eluent from the elutriator is passed over a series of sieves which retains material greater than 300 m.  This retained material is preserved in 90% ethanol.  Invertebrates are then hand-sorted from the collected debris under a dissecting scope (25x), preserved in 75% ethanol and identified to the lowest practical taxon.</p>"

  abstract: "This method quantitatively determines the physical proportions of three sizes of primary soil particles as determined by their settling rates in an aqueous solution using a hydrometer. Proportions are represented by stated class sizes: sand ranging from 2000 - 50 \xC2\xB5m; silt ranging from 50 - 2.0 \xC2\xB5m and clay < 2.0 \xC2\xB5m and those stated by the USDA Soil Survey and Canadian Soil Survey Committee. Settling rates of primary particles are based on the principle of sedimentation as described by Stokes\xE2\x80\x99Law and measured using a hydrometer. The use of the ASTM 152H-Type hydrometer is based on a standard temperature of 20 <sup>o</sup>C and a particle density of 2.65 g cm<sup>-3</sup> and units are expressed as grams of soil per liter. For specific samples the method may require the pretreatment removal of soluble salts, organic matter, carbonate sand iron oxides with subsequent dispersion using sodium hexametaphosphate .Corrections for temperature and for solution viscosity is made by taking a hydrometer reading of a blank solution. Generally this method is of lower precision than the pipette or sedimentation methods and is used to determine soil texture. The method has a detection limit of 2.0% sand, silt and clay (dry basis) and is generally reproducible to within \xC2\xB1 8%."

    \r\n\
    Above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) is measured at the KBS LTER in habitats ranging from annual cropping systems to deciduous forests. The diverse plant communities in these habitats require different harvest and/or sampling methods. All measurements are taken pre-harvest at peak annual biomass for major community components. This generally means physiological maturity for annuals, before incorporation for cover crops, pre-senescence for perennials, and pre-harvest for alfalfa.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For Treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and SF (successional field) ANPP is assessed by harvesting all the above ground portion of plants that are rooted within the bounds of the harvest quadrat. The quadrat size totals 1 m 2 but the dimensions vary depending on the crop row spacing in the annual systems (T1-4) and are described in Table 1. The quadrat size for T5-SF is 0.5 by 2.0 m (1m 2 ). Quadrats are oriented with the long side in an east - west direction. This direction is perpendicular to the crop rows (in planted systems) and allows for assessment of both the row and interrow plant communities. All plants within the quadrat are clipped at ground level, bagged, and stored at 4 degrees C until botanical separations are performed. Harvested plants are separated by species and identified using a five to six letter code system. Five letter codes are used for nonwoody species and six letter codes are used for woody species, using the first three letters of both genus and species to create the code. In some cases plants are composited into crop and non dominant plant component. Crops are further separated into seed and stover. Plants are dried at 60 degrees C for a minimum of 48 hours and dry weights recorded along with the date of harvest, field replicate, treatment, sampling station and species code.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In Treatment 5 (poplar plantation) biomass estimates are derived from measurements of basal diameter using an allometric relationship between diameter and biomass determined from a subset of trees harvested prior to leaf drop. In the DF (deciduous forest) and CF (conifer forest) wood annual growth is estimated by changes in stem diameter using an allometric equation available in Tritton and Hornbeck (1982). Leaf production in sites with trees is estimated with five 0.5 x 0.95 m litter traps placed on the forest floor of each site.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Details for the ANPP estimates for all treatments are provided below.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Plant tissue is dried and the total biomass of the plot is recorded. The tissue is then threshed (Almaco corn or small grain thresher) to separate the seed from stover. Seeds are dried at 60 C and the biomass is recorded. Seed and stover tissue sub samples are collected, combined by tissue type over stations, ground and archived for further analysis.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Poplar woody biomass has been estimated using a regression equation developed from a destructive harvest each fall prior to fall leaf drop. Historically basal tree diameter squared has been the best predictor of total tree biomass.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    * Allometric measures of basal tree diameter (mm) at 15 cm above the soil surface are taken in December . The measurements are made on 5 randomly chosen trees in the 2 x 1 m density plots . Data for rep, tree #, diameter (mm) are entered into a poplar allometric spreadsheet. A histogram of tree diameter is generated to establish the range of diameters and to develop size classes used in the destructive harvest to follow. The regression equation developed in the destructive harvest is used in conjunction with the diameter measures to estimate the biomass.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    * Mean woody tree biomass (kg/tree) is converted to mean woody areal extent on the basis of 0.5 trees per m 2 .\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The 2 x 1m density trees are a matrix of 86 trees (EW) by 27 trees (NS) within a 88.3 by 53.2 m area = 2322 trees/ 4697.56 m 2 = 0.49 trees/m 2\r\n\

    The following predictive equations for poplar woody or total biomass have been generated using the destructive harvest technique. Reported are equations pertaining to the main site 2 x 1 m spacing, however equations specific to tree density spacings and non dominant plant biomass/non dominant plant biomass free growth may be available from the investigating lab for that season. Diameter is measured as mm from 15 cm from the ground unless specified otherwise. Trees were planted as 25 cm cuttings in 1989.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Plants are hand harvested using a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat at each of the five sampling stations. A reduced harvest area is used due to the limited size of the plots. The dominant plants have primarily perennial life histories and mature over a range of the summer months. Cool season grasses (e.g. Bromus sp.) and late season perennials (e.g. Solidago sp.) are dominants, and a harvest in early August allows for reasonable assessment of both types of communities. Botanical separations are performed by species by station, dried, and the dry biomass for each species at each station is obtained.\r\n\

    Annual growth is estimated by changes in stem diameter for all trees over 5 cm dbh within each of the three DF/CF stands. Stem diameters are measured in the winter with dbh tape at 4 points on the stem. The 4 points are established by hanging a measuring chain from a nail at 5 feet from the ground.  Average diameters are used to estimate individual tree mass based on allometric equations available in Tritton and Hornbeck (1982):\r\n\

    <p>Sampling Frequency: minimum of once per month through the growing season (April -October) </p> <p>Composite soil samples consist of 1-inch composited cores per plot taken to soil depth at each of the 5 baseline sampling stations per plot .  At each sampling station, cores are taken perpendicular to the crop row and between rows .  Soil cores from poplar plots are taken on a diagonal transect between two trees .  In successional plots cores are taken at 7.5&quot; intervals from an arbitrary starting point .  No soil cores are taken across wheel-track rows in any plots .  Soil cores from each plot are sieved and mixed into one soil composite sample  .</p>

  body: |-
    <p>Soil cores are taken at 5 sampling stations per plot. Soil cores (2.5
    cm dia.) are taken north of each station flag to a depth of 25 cm. An
    equal number of cores are taken within row and between row when row
    crops are grown. All cores from each plot are composited in one sampling
    bag. A standard sampling consists of 2 cores at each station. 
     Forested sites are
    collected by one person at the same time the main site is being
    sampled. If 5 people are not available the forested sites maybe
    sampled in the afternoon while soil from the main site is being
    sieved.</p>
    
    <p>The soil is brought to the lab and sieved through a 4 mm screen to
    remove debris and to homogenize the soil sample. Each treatment has a
    specific screen in order to reduce contamination between
    treatments. Latex gloves are worn when sieving and mixing the
    soil.</p>
    
    <p>Field moist soil is stored at 4 C until the inorganic N determinations are completed. All samples, except the April sample, are
    disposed of at the end of the year. The April sample is archived for
    CN analysis.</p>
    
    
    Once per year mineralization in July.
    
    <p>Mineralization potential may be assessed by as the difference in
    nitrate and ammonia values from the initial sampling and an
    &quot;incubated&quot; sample. Incubations are perfomed on a subsample
    of the initial composite sample which is placed into a gas-permeable
    plastic bag and buried in the plot from which the soil
    originated. Incubation length is 21 days. (see Short-term
    mineralization file for details).</p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Label plastic bags with appropriate information about the
      sample (e.g. project, date, plot, variate. Cover labels with clear
      mailing tape to secure label to bag and to protect against
      moisture.</li>
      <li>Prepare sampling buckets. Each bucket should have the
      following: site map, sharpie marker, butter knife, sampling bags,
      and soil probe.</li>
      <li>Take samples to 25 cm at each of the 5 sampling stations. A
      butter knife is helpful in removing soil from the probe. In cropped
      systems, take two cores per station, one in the row and one between the row. Take the same number of cores from
      non-cropped systems. Composite all samples for each plot in one
      plastic bag.</li>
      <li>Tie the sample bag and place in the alleyway to be picked up
      when the sampling is completed. All efforts should be made to
      complete sampling in all plots on the same day.</li>
      <li>Take a core at the edge of the next plot to clean the soil
      probe. This will reduce contamination between plots.</li>
      <li>Pick up soil samples and return to field lab.</li>
      <li>Separate soils by treatment.</li>
      <li>Wear latex gloves while sieving. Sieve each soil sample using
      the 4 mm mesh soil sieve labeled for that treatment. Sieves are kept
      in the field lab.</li>
      <li>Sieve soil into a plastic tote tray. Return sieved soil to the
      plastic sample bag. Discard rocks and large organic matter remaining
      on the screen.</li>
      <li>Brush sieve and tote tray clean.</li>
      <li>Change latex gloves after each treatment.</li>
    
    <li>Place soil samples into 4 degrees C
    refrigerator</li>

  description: ""
  abstract: The LTER GPS units are used for recording the locations of microplots, experiments, instrumentation, plot corners, sampling sites, events and many other LTER features. They are often used to navigate back to these locations and to navigate to new locations whose coordinates have been uploaded to the GPS.
  body: "<h3>Hardware</h3>\r\n\
    <p>The KBS LTER has two identical Trimble GPS units. \xE2\x80\x9CGPS I\xE2\x80\x9D is to be used exclusively by the KBS LTER staff. \xE2\x80\x9CGPS II\xE2\x80\x9D can be loaned to others with permission by the LTER Project Manager.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Two components make up each GPS unit: the Trimble TSCe Data Logger with touch screen, and the Trimble Receiver Type Pro XRS model 33302-51.\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    <h3>Software</h3>\r\n\
    <ol>\r\n\
    <li>Windows CE.net- Operating system on the TSCe Data Logger.</li>\r\n\
    <li>TerraSync \xE2\x80\x93 Used for collecting and updating GPS data on the Trimble Data Logger.</li>\r\n\
    <li>Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office (Version 4.1)- Used to import, export, and post-process the GPS data on the PC.</li>\r\n\
    <li>Microsoft Active Sync 4.5 \xE2\x80\x93 Used to connect your PC to the Trimble Data Logger in order to transfer data.</li>\r\n\
    </ol>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <h3>Accuracy</h3>\r\n\
    <p>\r\n\
    When using the Trimble XRS Pro GPS with the Omnistar real-time correction service or the internal Coast Guard beacon we can expect submeter accuracy (approximately + 20 to +70).  Previously we used the Omnistar real-time correction service but now we will be using the internal Coast Guard beacon; the Coast Guard beacon has similar accuracy at no cost.\r\n\
    </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Prior to collecting data, the Trimble Planning software is used to determine occasional times throughout the day when the satellites alignment is suboptimal.  This allows us avoid data collection at these times.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thirty positions are collected at 1 second intervals for each feature and are averaged.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The GPS is set to only allow collection of data when the PDOP (position- dilution of precision) does not exceed 4.  This can be relaxed when collecting data in forested sites if needed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Post-processing of data is carried out using the Trimble GPS Pathfinder Office software and a nearby CORS (Continuously Operating Reference Stations) station.  </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Trimble GPS files are sent to the LTER database manager for long-term storage on the LTER website. </p>   \r\n\
    <p>Detailed instructions for using the KBS LTER GPS can also be found on the internal LTER website under instructions.</p>\r\n"

    <h2>Protocol for Nitrogen application in forest and successional field plots</h2>
    
    Fertilized (F) plots are 100 m<super>2</super> (10m x 10m) each, except in CF3, where the fertilized plot is 6m2(2m x 3m).  Annual application rate is 100 kg Nitrogen (N) ha<super>-1</super> as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to 1 kg (60 g on CF3) N per plot.  The N is added in 3 doses.  Each time 16 L (4 L on CF3) of fertilizer solution are added per plot.  The 3 doses are applied in the period April thru November (after spring thaw thru litterfall).
    Three-fold fertilization (3F) plots are 4m<super>2</super>(2m x 2m) each.  The annual application rate is 300 kg N ha<super>-1</super> added in 4 L per plot solutions.
  body: |
    <h2>Preparing the Fertilization solutions</h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Weigh 8 bags of 980g NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> (34% N) for 1F, 1 bag of 58.8g NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> (34% N) for 1F in CF3, and 9 bags of 118g in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> (34% N) for 3F.</li>
    <li>Mix fertilizer with RO water in 4L flasks with stir bars on stir plate.  Add fertilizer slowly to allow it to dissolve.</li>
    <li>Pour solutions into 4L or 16L sprayers and carboys for spraying or transport to the field.</li>
    <li>Fill the containers for 1F plots to 16L and the containers for CF3-1F and all 3F plots to 4L.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Spraying the plots</h2>
    
    <p>Use a 16L backpack sprayer to apply the fertilizer solutions to the 1F plots and a 4L hand sprayer for the 3F plots and 1F in CF3.  Divide the 1F plots into quadrants and apply 4 liters of solution to each.  In the 3F plots, apply the 4 liters of solution evenly across the plot.</p>

  abstract: "h3. Fall Surface Soil Sampling\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Fall surface soils samples are taken to 25 cm in two depth increments: 0-10 and 10-25 cm using an 8 cm dia. Eijkelkamp root auger. At each of three sample stations per plot, one sample is taken within the row and another between rows. Soils at stations are composited by depth, to yield 3 composite samples per plot for each depth increment. Back in the lab, soils are weighed, sieved, and subsampled to provide the following measures: bulk density, total carbon and nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, pH, gravimetric moisture, and microbial biomass. A separate 0-25 cm subsample taken by push probe and composited by plot is also sent to a university test lab for standard agronomic soil recommendations (N, P, and major cations).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. Spring Surface Soil Sampling\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Spring surface soil samples are taken with a push probe (2 cm dia.) to 25 cm depth. At each of the three sample stations per plot one sample is taken within the row and another between rows. Soils at stations are composited to yield 1 composite sample per plot. Back in the lab, soils are weighed, sieved, and subsampled for inorganic nitrogen and gravimetric moisture.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. Deep Soil Sampling\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Soil cores to 1 m depth are taken once every 5 years to follow long-term carbon change. Intact cores (6 cm dia.) are taken with a hydraulic probe (Geoprobe model RS60, Geoprobe Systems; Salina, Kansas) at each of 3 sampling stations (one core/station) in late spring / early summer. For the row crops, cores are taken between the rows. Cores are refrigerated until analyzed. Analyses include depth to major soil horizons (Ap, Bt, and Bt2 at KBS) and by specific depth intervals (0-10, 10-25, 25-50, and 50-100 cm), bulk density, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and carbonate content. The initial sampling also includes cation exchange capacity and soil texture for each depth interval composited by plot. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. In situ N Availability\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To follow seasonal patterns of N availability ion exchange resin strips (2.5 \xC3\x97 10 cm) are placed in the field on a monthly basis from March to November. Cation and anion strips are placed at each of the three sample stations and left in place for 4 weeks."
  body: "h3. Sample Locations\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sampling locations within all plots are identical following the stratified random placement of three sample stations at plot establishment. Sampling by station increases the potential for identifying early treatment differences but care must be taken to avoid taking more than one sample from a particular spot and to avoid excessive plot disturbance. Table 1 provides suggested locations, which must necessarily be flexible to allow for the need to retake cores that encounter rocks or excessive compaction. \r\n\

  abstract: |
    GLBRC intensive-plot treatments include systems ranging from annual crops to native prairie. Different harvest and/or sampling methods are required to quantify these diverse plant communities. All measurements are taken pre-harvest at peak annual biomass for major community components. This generally means physiological maturity for annuals and pre-senescence for perennials. Plant biomass samples are taken from each of the 3 sampling stations within a plot (Fig.1). Note that ANPP is different from yield, which represents some (usually high) portion of ANPP.
    

  body: "For the treatments G1 to G10, ANPP is assessed by harvesting all the above ground portion of plants that are rooted within the bounds of a harvest quadrat. The quadrat size totals 1 m 2 but the dimensions vary depending on the crop row spacing in the annual systems (G1-4) and are described in Table 1. Quadrats are oriented with the long side in an east \xE2\x80\x93 west direction (Table 2).This direction is perpendicular to the crop rows (in planted systems) and allows for assessment of both the row and inter-row plant communities. All plants rooted within the quadrat are clipped at ground level, bagged, and dried at 600C for a minimum of 48 hours and dry weights are recorded along with the date of harvest, field replicate, treatment, sampling station and species code. Before drying, harvested plants are separated by species and labeled following the standardized codes given under LTER datasets in above ground productivity protocol (http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/36). Six letter codes are used for woody species, using the first three letters of both genus and species to create the code. In some cases plants are composited into crop and non dominant plant component. Crops are further separated into seed and stover. In Treatment G8 (poplar plantation) biomass estimates are derived from measurements of basal diameter using an allometric relationship between diameter and biomass determined from a subset of trees harvested prior to leaf drop. Leaf production in sites with trees is estimated with two 1.0\xC3\x972.0 m litter traps placed on the field floor of each site.\r\n\

    Measure biomass at or near crop physiological maturity. In corn, physiological maturity is signified by a \"black layer\" located within the base of a kernel, which normally forms about 60 days after silking or 20 days after denting. In soybean, peak biomass sampling should be done prior to leaf drop or when only few leaves and petioles have dropped. At this stage the pods on all positions on the stem are losing green color and at least one normal pod on the main stem has turned yellow. In canola, biomass samples should be taken before swathing. At this stage, seeds in lower pods look green-brown or green-yellow mottled. The canola crop should be monitored carefully as these stages change very rapidly during the ripening period if conditions are warm and dry.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For years with cover crops, cover crop biomass must also be measured at peak biomass, usually just prior to killing (and possibly harvesting) the cover crop at the time the main crop is planted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Clip all the plants rooted within the quadrats to ground level and place in labeled bags. For corn, plants from each quadrat are cut into small pieces before putting them into bags. Place bags in an oven at 600C for 48 h for drying. Weigh the dried mass of plant material and record the total biomass of the plot. Bag contents are then threshed (Almaco corn or small grain thresher) to separate the seeds from stover (corn) and shells (soybean and canola). Seed biomass is recorded and moisture sub samples are taken using a Burrows Digital Moisture Computer 700. Seed, stover, and vegetative biomass is combined by tissue type within plots (over stations), and saved for later grinding and nutrient analysis. \r\n\

    At harvest (or at peak biomass for establishment year with no harvest) above-ground material within quadrats is clipped at ground level and partitioned into dead leaf, green leaf, pseudostem and flower/seed heads. Leaves are detached from the pseudostem at the ligule. Green leaves, green stems and senesced material are oven dried and weighed to obtain aboveground live and dead biomass. Detached senesced biomass (litter) is also gathered from the clipped area and dried and weighed. Seed heads on the ground should be added to the stem samples. After weighing the samples, plant material is ground for carbon and nitrogen analysis.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    During establishment years mowing may be used to control weeds. Mown biomass must be quantified to include in the measure of ANPP. After mowing, place 1m2 (2.0 m x 0.5 m) quadrats randomly at 3 spots (in 2008-2mS, 2mW). Dry and weigh.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In the establishment year, the biomass is determined using 1 m2 quadrat but in subsequent years the quadrat size can be reduced to 0.25 m2 because by that time the stems will occupy the empty spaces between the original plants.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In addition to biomass, prior to harvest record the maximum height of each plant as measured from ground level to the tip of the extended upper leaf or inflorescence. Also record the number of stems (> 2 cm high) per 5 plants per quadrat at each station.\r\n\

    Above ground productivity is estimated at peak biomass, usually in August, by clipping all plants at ground level. Peak biomass is a good estimate of net primary productivity in this system because frost kills aboveground biomass during the winter and there is no carryover of biomass from year to year. The procedure for collecting biomass is same as in other treatments. Before drying the samples, plants are sorted to species. Each plant species sample is put into different bags, dried and weighed for biomass. After taking dried weight, sampled are ground for carbon and nitrogen analysis.\r\n\

    Calculate the mean total biomass per plot on a dry weight basis (summation of each species biomass).\r\n\

    h4. Woody increment growth\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A regression equation is used to estimate woody biomass. The equation is variety-specific, so must be created over a rotation interval if it is not otherwise available. Creating the equation requires sampling and weighing several trees after diameter measurements are taken. Harvesting of poplars is done each year in December. Ten trees (2 trees/replicate plot) are chosen to cover a representation of trees in each diameter size class for that year; trees should be taken from a plot edge. Trees are measured for basal diameter at 15 cm above the soil surface, then cut at ground level and measured for dry weight of branches and stem (separately); basal diameter where cut (mm), and total tree height (m). Separate regressions are developed to relate tree height, tree diameter, and basal area to woody tree mass (branches plus stem mass) to determine the best equation to use to predict mass from diameter measurements.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Also in December, measurements of basal tree diameter (mm) at 15 cm above the soil surface are taken on 9 labeled trees per plot (3 per station, selected randomly). The same 9 trees are sampled each year to follow diameter change. The regression equation developed in the destructive harvest is used in conjunction with the diameter measures to estimate the woody biomass of each of the flagged trees.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Calculate the mean woody tree biomass (kg/tree) and convert it to mean woody areal extent on the basis of 0.27 trees per m 2. (trees are planted on a 2.43 x 1.52 m spacing)\r\n\

    Calculate woody growth increment: The difference of the mean woody tree biomass between successive growing seasons (g/m2/y) for each plot\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h4. Litterfall biomass\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Poplar leaves drop throughout the growing season. Leaf litter is collected in 1.0\xC3\x972.0 m wooden litter trap frames (size was designed to fit within or between poplar rows). Two traps are placed 2 meters towards west side of stations 1 and 2 within the rows in each plot following leaf emergence in late May. Leaves within the traps are collected throughout the season, dried, weighed, and archived for tissue analysis.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Calculate the mean litter biomass (g/m2) per plot per collection date.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Calculate on a per plot basis the sum of woody growth increment and leaf fall by plot, SE, and n=5 reps (blocks).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Report for ANPP the mean sum, SE, and n=5 reps (blocks).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. Cover crop\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Cover crop biomass should be measured at time of peak biomass for the crop (at or just prior to senescence or winter dormancy). If crops are mowed prior to peak biomass the mowed biomass should be added to peak biomass for an annual total, as described for the grass treatments.\r\n\
