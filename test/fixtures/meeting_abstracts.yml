  abstract: Disturbance to terrestrial ecosystems as a consequence of agriculture, deforestation, and land degradation over the last century has resulted in a net loss of soil C. Native forest soils contain 25 to 50% more C than associated agricultural sites. Increased C storage capacity in afforested agricultural land has the potential to mitigate increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from anthropogenic sources. We evaluated C dynamics of afforested, native and agricultural areas of known history on similar soil types at the Fred Russ Forest managed by Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), Newton Woods and associated agricultural land in southern Michigan. A three pool constrained model was utilized to examine turnover rates of soil C pools to determine whether soil C sequestration resulting from afforestation of agricultural lands can contribute to changes in global C cycles.Our results from Russ Forest show significant differences in total C and N in the B horizon, and C horizon for the Afforested and Agricultural soils. Differences in bulk density and horizon depth necessitate corrections within treatments so that profiles are compared on the basis of equal soil weight. Total profile C and N corrected for equal soil weight also differed significantly among afforested, agricultural, and native soils. Results from long-term incubations showed differences in C dynamics among the three land types. A two pool constrained model constructed using the rate curve from CO<sub>2</sub> evolution during incubations resulted in a larger C<sub>a</sub> pool in the top 20 cm of soil for the Agricultural soils (302 mg/kg soil-4.3 % of total C) than the Afforested soils (261 mg/kg soil-1.25 of total C).These results have a number of implications for global change. The Russ Forest has large quantities of C stored in biomass, litter and soils. The afforested biomass and soil currently contain an estimated 122 Mg C/ha and 7.6 Mg N/ha while the comparable agricultural sites contain 56 Mg C/ha and 5.4 Mg N/ha. This represents an increase in C storage in the afforested site of approximately 66 Mg C/ha and 2.2 Mg N/ha since the forest was planted in the mid forties Additionally, afforested soils are sequestering soil C in pools with longer MRT&rsquo;s. Additional studies on the effects of afforestation on C sequestration will include sites from the KBS-Long Term Ecological Research Station poplar plots, deciduous and coniferous forest plots, and associated agricultural plots.

  abstract: "Soil fungi are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems. They live in both moderate and harsh environments, degrade almost all organic residues and outweigh all other soil microbiota (including bacteria) in both richness of species and biomass. To flourish in diverse environments, soil fungi possess a wide array of degradative capabilities. Consequently, they play a dominant role in soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrition, as well as in the biogeochemical cycling of various elements including carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The study of soil fungi is therefore crucial to research in three priority areas of ecology: biodiversity, long term ecological research and global change.</font><font size=\"2\">Soil basidiomycetes are a group of soil fungi that are responsible for the majority of the degradation of lignocellulose plant residues, soil organic matter and polyaromatic pollutants in soil. Since the combined total of lignocellulose and soil humics represent a major reserve of terrestrial C (i.e. 350-500 pentograms), the soil basidiomycetes therefore play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycling of C. Soil basidiomycetes are effective at these degradative processes because:</font><font size=\"2\">Although the importance of basidiomycetes in soils is well recognized, there is little known about the diversity of these organisms. Even less is known about the ecosystem controls that select for basidiomycetous communities. The primary roadblock to the investigation of soil basidiomycetes has been a historic lack of methods to isolate them. Even in the few cases where isolation has been successful, the identification of isolates has been difficult (to impossible). We have addressed these problems by developing techniques and a selective medium which allow, for the first time, the routine isolation of soil basidiomycetes. A combination of particle washing, selective inhibitors and use of a commercially available lignin as the primary C source resulted in the isolation of 67 KBS soil basidiomycetes representing 51 morpho-taxo groups. The majority of these could not be classified utilizing traditional taxonomic characteristics. Therefore, rDNA sequences of the unknown isolates are now being used to generate a phylogenetic tree which includes reference sequences obtained from sequence libraries and databases. While some of the isolates have be placed into known taxonomic groups, many of the isolates appear to be species/genera that have not been previously described.</font><font size=\"2\">In addition to our isolation methods, we are developing techniques to extract total microbial DNA from soils and selectively amplify informative stretches of basidiomycete rDNA. These amplified sequences will be separated and used for phylogenetic assesment of soil basidiomycetes. This will allow us to study both culturable and nonculturable species.</font><font size=\"2\">We will use the above techniques to study the diversity soil basidiomycetes inhabiting a range of treatments at the KBS LTER site. We will investigate how the community structure of basidiomycetes in soils is impacted by plant material inputs as well as chemical and physical perturbations. This will be accomplished through: 1) characterization and comparison of the richness of species of soil basidiomycetes; 2) determination of their functional diversity (the richness and heterogeneity of lignin modifying enzymes encoded by soil basidiomycete isolates) and; 3) measurement of the actual decomposition they carry out.</font><font size=\"2\">Information on species richness and functional diversity will be related to ecosystem processes by integrating the molecular studies with litter exchange experiments. The litter experiments utilize the difference in the 13C signal of corn versus that of deciduous forest leaves (oak and hickory) to measure decomposition. The use of a lignin-humate analog known to be degraded by the lignolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes will further relate the diversity and function data to ecosystem processes. The inclusion of information on basidiomycete populations and function should greatly improve the Century model we use to describe the decomposition rates of forest and agricultural treatments. This study will incorporate the application of molecular based techniques to ecological-ecosystem questions. It will also provide a great deal of fundamental information on an important, previously uncharacterized component of terrestrial ecosystems--the basidiomycetous soil fungi.. The hypotheses we will test include:</font>"

  abstract: Simulation of physical and biological phenomena at multiple time and space scales is playing a pivotal role in areas that range from genetic studies to global change analysis and assessment. Regional simulation models require the use of large data inputs and are evolving in scope and sophistication. A Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework (MASIF) is presented as a method to facilitate utilization of large amounts of spatial-temporal outputs from regional scale simulations. MASIF links an array of existing visualization, analytical, and data management software to manage model inputs and outputs as well as model execution.&nbsp; MASIF can be implemented as a stand-alone or web-based system to accommodate batch and interactive processing scenarios. We have used a maize crop growth model to demonstrate the potential of this approach to handle millions of location-specific input/output records that are processed for each model run.&nbsp; Under MASIF control, model output was processed into a time series of maps that were exported to animation software to create digital videos of model simulation outputs providing a graphical analysis of daily temporal and spatial dynamics of maize growth in the North Central Corn Belt over a 20-year period. In addition, we have included examples that demonstrate MASIF capabilities for statistical analysis. Information from MASIF is shown in visual form, an approach that we believe is preferable for comprehending information contained in large datasets associated with models that simulate processes and patterns at regional scales.

  abstract: The structure of microbial communities in naturally vegetated systems has been assumed to be driven by bottom-up forces; i.e., the quality, quantity and availability of plant-derived resources. We tested the hypothesis that plant composition, in particular the identity of the dominant species, plays a larger role in determining microbial community structure than plant diversity. Three community types on the KBS LTER were sampled in 1997; successional oldfields (T7) and poplars (T5) with and without (herbicide treated) herbaceous weeds. Herbaceous plant composition and biomass, poplar woody biomass increment, and annual leaf litter biomass was used to assess plant community similarity and total annual net primary productivity (ANPP). Soils were sampled in six replicate successional plots in mid-August at two spatial scales; across the entire 1 ha plot and within a 1m x 10 m strip located in the interior of the plot. Soil samples in the weedy and weed-free poplars were collected from microplots (approx. 15m x 15m)in mid-September.&nbsp; Soils were sampled to a depth of 15 cm and sieved to 4mm prior to analysis.&nbsp; The soil microbial communities were differentiated based on Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiles and the community potential use of 23 single carbon substrates (Biolog).In 1997 ANPP varied among the plant communities ranging from273-820 g/m2/yr. The weedy poplar community had the highest total productivity (wood, leaves, herbaceous biomass), and the weed-free poplars the lowest. Although herbaceous species richness was higher in the successional old fields than the weedy poplars (19 vs 13), plant composition was similar. This result suggests that the majority of difference between the successional oldfields and weedy poplars is the presence of poplar trees and roots. Soil microbes in these three plant community types tended to differentiate based on their FAME profiles, with the weedy poplar community intermediate to that of the successional and weed-free poplar communities. Microbial communities in weedy and weed-free poplars had distinct patterns of potential C-source utilization from the community in the successional oldfields. This difference, based on the relative utilization of two amino acids, L-asparagine and putrescine, suggests that the microbial community is responding to rhizosphere products and exudates of the poplar trees.For the plant community types examined, the soil microbial communities reflected differences in plant species composition, particular the presence of a biomass dominant. There were some differences in microbial composition between the weed-free poplars (a monoculture) and weedy poplars (species richness =14), suggesting that species diversity may have played a role as well in structuring the microbial communities.

    Alfalfa increased mineral soil N by decreasing leaching losses of fixed plant and residual soil nitrogen (Rasse and Smucker, 1999). Soil and plant nitrogen pools were studied under rye cover cropping of a Kalamazoo loam soil (mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) from 1997 to 1999 under four regimes of soil and plant residues: 1) bare fallow soil (F), 2) bare fallow soil with rye shoot mulch applied in May (FS), 3) bare soil with rye roots (shoots removed) in May (RR), and 4) rye cover with rye roots and shoot mulch applied to the soil surface in May (RRS). Extractable soil N was maximum in April 1998 in F treatments. RR treatments delayed maximum accumulations of soil N until August 1998. Rye cover crops decreased soil N by nearly 160 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>during the wet periods from December 1997 to April 1998. Much of this N was absorbed by the rye cover. Rye cover retained more of the remaining soil N in the upper soil horizons within reach of roots by the successive corn crop. After spring killing of the rye cover, soil extractable N contents increased 150 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, from 192 to 342 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>. These results suggest that roots of winter rye cover sequester soil N and reduce deep leaching of soluble soil N when compared to bare fallow soil. This timely sequestered and slow-release soil N can be used by succeeding corn plants reducing fertilizer costs and NO<sub>3</sub> leaching from the soil profile.

  abstract: "Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) comes from China and was first sighted in the United States in July of 2000.  Severe damage to soybean plants by this aphid has already been documented.  Previous to this invasion there were few aphids feeding on soybean.  While many other infested states are importing natural enemies in a biological control effort, Michigan has held off.  It may be that native and previously introduced natural enemies of aphids which are already established in our area can adapt to soybean aphid.  However nobody to date has performed an extensive and thorough search for early adaptation to this invading species. Natural enemies of aphids can occur in a diversity of habitats.  Alfalpha in particular is known to be home to several species of aphid predators and parasitoids.  To what degree can native and previously introduced natural enemies adapt to a new invader?:\n\n\
    To detect the presence of parasitoids and predatory flies that have been able to adapt to soybean aphid as a source of prey/hosts.  We also seek signs of early adaptation to this invading species and evidence that there are enough natural enemies that can adapt to SBA already in place in the LETR system to allow for effective biological control of SBA. We also hope to gather enough information to propose some possible methods for conserving and augmenting these natural enemies of SBA.\n\n\
    SBA natural enemies were sampled 3 times, June through September. 80 pots of soybean infested with SBA were placed in different treatments in a field setting at KBS LTER main experimental site in 20 sets of four.  The pots were divided into four of KBS\x92s treatments: At each sampling period for 2 days, pots were exposed to parasitoids and predatory flies of the SBA.  The parasitoids oviposited in aphids and the flies oviposited on aphid-infested soybean foliage of the pots.  After the two days of exposure the soybean plants were clipped and placed in emergence canisters to trap emerging adult parasitoids and predatory flies. This technique is more labor intensive than simply collecting soybean plants from the field, but allowed us to sample other habitats such as alphalpha.  \n\n\
    We have detected a diverse assemblage of native or previously introduced natural enemies attacking SBA. In general diptheran predators seem to be more abundant early in the season, and hymenopteran parasitoids seem to be more abundant later in the season.  Individual braconid species seem to be much more habitat selective than the aphelinids and diptheran predators"

  abstract: About half the nitrogen fertilizer applied to our crops each year is lost in the form of nitrates, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas (Robertson, 1997). From an economic standpoint this represents loss of return for farmers. Excess nitrogen fertilizer, rather than being converted for use in plants is allowed to leach into ground water and streams as unused nitrates. Nitrate leaching into ground and surface water leads to eutrophication, Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia, and blue baby syndrome from the contamination of drinking water around agriculture regions. Nitrous oxide contributes to the greenhouse effect, and agricultural soils are responsible for about 50% of the nitrous oxide flux worldwide (Kroeze et al., 2000, Galloway et al. 2003).Reducing the loss of nitrogen from row cropping systems, especially maize, would be a great benefit for farmers and public health. A common way to manage N loss is to look at the grain response, If the maize has been saturated with nitrogen fertilizer then the plant grain response to increasing applications of nitrogen fertilizer will plateau.Another method of determining nitrogen saturation is to study the root systems of the plant, since they are the main source of nitrogen uptake.Back to Poster Titles

  abstract: Quantitative assessment of soil carbon has gained increased interest in the recent past, owing to its importance for carbon sequestration studies and its potential impact on global climate change. Soil carbon management is a key issue in many sustainable agriculture programs and global climate change studies. However, accuracy in estimating soil C to determine best management practices is hindered by the inherent variability of soil properties that is widespread in soils across all scales. Soil carbon content varies across fields as a result of complex interactions among factors such as soil properties, tillage practices, and terrain attributes. Our objective is to study the effect of topography on spatial variability of the total soil carbon, content under different management systems. The studied topographical features include relative elevation terrain slope, curvature, aspect and soil wetness index. The three studied management systems are treatments from the RCBD experiment with six replications at the Long Term Ecological Research site at Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan. We studied two systems with conventional chemical inputs (chisel plow and no-till) and a certified organic chisel plowed system with a winter leguminous cover crop and no manure or compost inputs. The elevation measurements at a 2 m interval were collected with a 12-channel Leica SR530 real time kinematic DGPS receiver. Terrain derivatives were obtained from the elevation data using surface and hydrologic analysis of ARCMAP spatial analyst. From each of 18 sampled 1-ha experimental plots we collected approximately 100 soil samples at 0-5 cm depth for total soil C measurements. The data were analyzed using multiple regression and analysis of covariance. Relationships between total carbon and topographical features observed in the 18 1-ha plots of the three studied systems will be presented and discussed.

  abstract: Western Corn Rootworm (WCR) in the Midwestern United States illustrates the ways that social factors and biophysical environmental factors interact in agricultural pest systems. The conventional wisdom has been that two- or three-year corn-soybean (or corn-soy-wheat) rotations act as a low-input, non-resistance inducing, means of holding WCR populations below economic damage thresholds. Recently, WCR "behavioral variants" have been found in areas near the Illinois-Indiana border and in isolated areas in Michigan and Ohio. These "rotation resistant" WCR have adapted to rotations and lay eggs in fields planted with soybeans, which leads to WCR populations in first-year corn near, at or above economic thresholds. Feeding assays and field studies by O'Neal et al. (2002) suggest that the WCR variant's behavior may be derived less from the development of a new genotype and more from the expression of already-present, but heretofore unnecessary, behavioral plasticity induced by new and unevenly distributed agroecological conditions. Our hypothesis is that the emergence of the WCR behavioral variant is largely caused by regional changes in cultivation practices - earlier planting dates and/or planting of new varieties that are more cold-hardy - which have disrupted the synchronicity between corn phenology and WCR development. A second-order hypothesis is that the unevenness of the distribution of the variant is associated with the distribution of rotational and crop-mixture diversity. The purpose of our study is to identify whether or not cultural practices and corn variety selection have changed in the spatial and temporal manner coincident with the arrival of WCR "behavioral variants" and with our hypotheses. Interviews with extension agents, farmers, and seed company representatives make it possible to determine examine these agroecological changes as they have developed over the past 20 years focus on crop rotations, pesticide applications, and crops planted.

  abstract: Previous research indicated that use of compost as a N fertilizer source decreased nitrification potentials. We used PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA fragments of beta-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of DGGE excised bands to determine whether the source (compost vs. inorganic sources) and quantity of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> influenced the community composition. DGGE patterns for soils in which compost management and inorganic fertilizer were compared showed little banding variation. However, band intensity within lanes of the same DGGE gel suggested a difference in relative abundance of dominant ammonia-oxidizers in compost amended soil. Comparison of DGGE patterns from agronomic and grassland soils indicated that community structure differs between ecosystem types rather than agronomic managements. Sequences isolated in 1994 from adjacent agronomic field plots were primarily <i>Nitrosospira</i> and identified as closely related to sequences from December 2001 suggesting that ammonia oxidizer communities are stable over long periods.

  abstract: 2,4-D has been applied to field plots for nine years to investigate the effect of 2,4-D on the microbial community and how changes in the microbial community could effect aspects of the nutrient transformation (C and N mineralization). The application rates were, control which is 0 kg/ha (0x), normal field rate of application 1 kg/ha (1X), 10 kg/ha (10X), 100 kg/ha (100X). During the eight and the ninth year, 2,4-D was applied every other week for five times from the month August and after its application, the microbial community was investigated by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) of the SSU rDNA genes. The effect of 2,4-D on the microorganisms was assessed by determining the microbial biomass, microbial respiration and the microbial C:N ratio. Carbon mineralization was determined by the static incubation method and similarly for Nitrogen mineralization the ammonium and nitrate concentrations were determined by KCL extraction.Microbial community fingerprint showed the absence of some population profiles in the 100X plots which were present in the other treatments. Differences in the peak profile occurred around the 400-450 bp region for plots with 100X 2,4-D application whilst the profiles of the other treatments were unaffected. An increase in the qCO2 indicated a possible disturbance of high 2,4-D application in the plot where 100X 2,4-D had been applied as compared to the control plots. C mineralization (Fig.2) and Net N mineralization slightly decreased for the 100X plots. Microbial biomass was reduced by 22% (Fig. 1) in treatments where 100X 2,4-D had been applied as compared to the control plots and other treatments. Similarly basal microbial respiration was also reduced as 2,4-D concentration increased. The rate of nitrification increased as the 2,4-D concentration increased indicating that the diamine of the 2,4-D formulation might have been a substrate for the nitrifiers. These results suggest that applying high 2,4-D rates continually for a period of time tends to effect some microbial populations and some ecosystem functionsReturn to Contents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Studies of changes in land use often focus on transitions between major categories of forested, agricultural, and residential. We propose that it is equally important to understand transitions within
    those categories. In this project we focus on the introduction, spread, and abandonment of agriculture in southwest Michigan, and ask how political economy, culture and biogeography have combined to produce a series of transformations in agricultural land use. The environmental and social history of the region has been divided into six time periods.  The first period, from 1850 to 1898, was a time of agricultural settlement. The second period, from 1898 to 1919, was a time of agricultural prosperity. The agricultural depression defined the third period, which lasted from 1919 to 1940. Agriculture in southwestern Michigan from 1940 to 1973 consisted of significant modernization and a shift towards Fordist agriculture. The fifth period, from 1973 to 1989, was marked by the first oil shock and declining agricultural profits.  The sixth and final period is a time of globalization, diversification, and restructuring. The southwest Michigan region consists of 18 counties surrounding the Kellogg Biological Station. Ecological and socioeconomic data for the region from 1850 until the present have been collected.  Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which farm animals mediate the relationships between agriculture and environment. By tracing land use and environmental change over a long time period, this project will identify the integrated, systemic relationship between political economic changes and ecological trends. Furthermore, this project will demonstrate how patterns of change are best understood through an interdisciplinary approach involving both social and natural science perspectives.

The proposed research will focus on five important factors. The first factor is the individual's beliefs and attitudes about soil processes and soil management. The second factor influencing soil management decisions is the market to which a farmer has access. The third factor influencing soil management decisions is farm programs; most of these are implemented at the national level. Policies which affect farmland and forest land management, the fourth factor, are set by national, state and local governments. Finally social and economic institutions establish the structural context in which farm operators and rural residents make decisions about soil management and land use.</font>

  abstract: "Both our world and our scientific understanding of the world are changing in fundamental ways: Our world is changing because human populations and the technological systems that support us have grown to the point where we are fundamentally altering the natural environmental systems that sustain all life on earth. Scientists are shifting the focus of their studies from natural systems to coupled human and natural systems for which the interplay between the systems that provide humans with food, energy, transportation, water, and housing and the earth's natural ecosystems has become a primary focus of study.The changing world changes the nature of responsible citizenship. We must try to develop education systems that will prepare all of our citizens to play their roles knowledgeably and responsibly. The required K-12 science curriculum needs to emulate recent developments in science by emphasizing inter-disciplinary accounts that reveal the linkages among environmental systems.We report assessments of K-12 students' reasoning about environmental systems. Trends from elementary through high school that show increasing understanding of both fundamental principles and processes in environmental systems. For example, high school students are much more likely than elementary school students to be aware of atomic-molecular and large scale systems, to suggest mechanisms for processes, and to try to apply fundamental principles such as conservation of matter and energy. Even at the high school level, though, most students' understanding of coupled human and natural systems is disturbingly incomplete. Very few students were able to connect atomic-molecular, macroscopic, and large-scale processes. Important aspects of environmental systems, including gases, decomposers, and connections between human and natural systems, remained \"invisible\" to most students (and thus were unaccounted for in their explanations of processes in systems)."

  abstract: Streams receive many anthropogenic sources of pollution, including increased nitrogen loading from agricultural areas. Denitrification, the conversion of nitrate (NO3-) to dinitrogen gas (N2), represents the only permanent loss of nitrogen from these systems. Nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, is also produced during denitrification in an intermediary step. The ratio of N2 to N2O produced during denitrification is unknown in many aquatic systems. Denitrification in streams occurs mainly in benthic substrata (organic matter accumulations) that vary in abundance between streams and are heterogeneously distributed within a stream. Denitrification has been measured using push-pull methods in groundwater and wetlands. Water containing a conservative solute plus nitrate is injected into the sediments, and then the injectate is withdrawn over time to quantify the rate of reactant uptake. Using 15N-labeled nitrate, we can measure its uptake as well as 15N2 and 15N2O production. This poster presents a proposed push-pull method to obtain in situ nitrate uptake rates and estimates of denitrification products within the microhabitats characteristic of stream systems.

  abstract: Complex interactions between demographic, economic, socio-cultural, and legal changes, and the environment have structured the history of Michigan&rsquo;s agricultural and natural resources. The increasing conflicts and debates over public and private control over the environment, its resources, and their development and management are outcomes of major changes in ecosystems and social systems. Throughout Michigan&rsquo;s history, shifting social trends interact with each other and with changes in landscape and land use, water quality, and fisheries and wildlife issues.Two hypotheses are explored:Using 1950 as a baseline, demographic data has been gathered and compared across decades to the present. This data forms the first part of a long-term data set on the KBS LTER site area. Data has been obtained on eleven counties in Southwest Michigan and on the urbanized areas near KBS. This data collection is nearing completion and an analysis of the import of this data for charting social systemic change is in progress. Initial indications are that the many of the changes are following patterns of demographic and socio-economic change at the national level, e.g., increased heterogeneity; migration reflecting increased presence of ex-urbanites in rural areas; expansion, contraction, and displacement in the labor force as outcome of economic cycles and restructuring.In the Fall, data collection on the structure of agriculture for five decades will begin. It is expected that we will complete that data set by the end of December. Next, data on natural resources (fisheries, wildlife, forestry, etc.) will be gathered. We will also identify key points of integration between biophysical and social system. Subsequently, we will begin to examine regional level processes impacting on the ecosystem.

  abstract: Agricultural ecosystems are an important source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, however, determination of the precise microbial processes contributing to nitrous oxide fluxes from soils has been very difficult.&nbsp; We investigated the isotopomer site preference in pure microbial culture and in soil incubations to determine if nitrous oxide flux can be attributed to a specific microbial process.&nbsp; The term isotopomer refers to not only the abundance of nitrogen isotopes in nitrous oxide but specifically to isotope abundance within each nitrogen atom within the nitrous oxide molecule.&nbsp; Thus the isotopomer site preference is the difference in <sup>15</sup>N between the central and outer nitrogen atoms in nitrous oxide.&nbsp; In pure microbial culture <i>of Nitrosomonas europaea</i>, we observed a site preference during nitrous oxide production of &#8211;1.4 <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 1.7 and &#8211;7.7 <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 3.1&nbsp; per mil with hydroxylamine and nitrite as the exclusive substrates, respectively.&nbsp; This result indicates that isotopomers can be used to separate nitrous oxide produced during nitrification from nitrite and hydroxylamine.&nbsp; Furthermore, in cultures of a methane oxidizer, <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> Bath, we observed a site preference of 5.5 <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 3.1 per mil that was markedly distinct from nitrous oxide produced by <i>Nitrosomonas</i>.&nbsp; During the reduction of nitrite by <i>Pseudomonas chloroaphis</i>, a denitrifying bacteria incapable of reducing nitrous oxide, we observed a site preference in nitrous oxide produced of &#8211;7.3 <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 3.0 per mil.&nbsp; Thus the site preferences in nitrous oxide produced during denitrification by Pseudomonas and during nitrification by Nitrosomonas are nearly identical.&nbsp; This observation is consistent with expectation that nitrous oxide production in nitrifiers proceeds by a similar chemical pathway as that used by denitrifiers.&nbsp; In anaerobic incubations of soils from the KBS LTER site, we observed no change in site preference during the consumption of nitrous oxide.&nbsp; Thus we conclude that reduction of nitrous oxide during denitrification has no effect on the site preference.&nbsp; Our work is an important step toward understanding the response of specific microbial processes and associated nitrous oxide fluxes to management activities.&nbsp;

  abstract: "An integrated model of agricultural and natural resource ecosystems requires a multidisciplinary systems approach which studies the points of interaction between natural and social systems. Key points of integration within various natural and social ecosystems include chemical, biological, geomorphological, and human dimensions. Both natural and social systems have histories and the essence of long term ecological research is to mark changes in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Human dimensions that have long term impacts on these ecosystems are explored at both a micro and a macro level. At the micro level, the understanding that farmers have of agro-ecological processes are related to their management of land. The farmer is seen as embodying: 1) the imperatives of culture of the local community, 2) the incentive structure by agricultural institutions, and 3) the constraints imposed by the social organization of agriculture. These factors from the farm impact the agroecosystem through the farm operator\x92s decision-making about the farm.  \n\n\
    Social dimensions are demographic (population size, distribution, migration); Economic (markets, division of labor, capital growth); Cultural (norms, values, knowledge); Social structural (networks and relationships, power structures, inequality). \n\n\
    At the macro level, we explore how historical patterns of global environmental change in agricultural and natural resources are impacted by long term transformations in the complex interactions among demographic, economic, socio-cultural, and legal changes and the environment. Changes in property rights, worldviews that consider resources as unlimited, and short-term economic logic produce adverse impacts on the ecosystem. Sustainability requires the emergence of conservation ethics that follow a longer -term economic logic, which asserts the rights of whole communities to take responsibility over the environment. Shifting social trends interact with each other and with changes in landscape and land use, water quality, and natural resources issues. The results are increasing conflicts and debates over public or private control over the environment, its resources, and their development and management. These complex interactions are approached in a set of conceptual models defining the human dimensional impacts on global environmental change and key points of integration between natural and social systems."

  abstract: Microbial nitrogen transformations in soil represent the most significant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), yet annual flux estimates are fraught with uncertainty due to limited measurements and high spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, the unknown contribution of specific microbial N<sub>2</sub>O production pathways to total flux limits our ability to model and predict soil fluxes. A robust and widely applicable method for measuring fluxes, therefore, is needed to constrain annual N<sub>2</sub>O budgets and to provide a process-based understanding of measurement variability. Here we discuss the development of an automated chamber system that will allow continuous measurement of N<sub>2</sub>O over a period of weeks to months. Such long-term measurements will improve the accuracy of flux estimates and allow collection of sufficient N<sub>2</sub>O for isotopomer abundance analysis to quantitatively apportion N<sub>2</sub>O sources. Our chamber design uses a conditioned molecular sieve trap to collect soil-derived N2O that is circulated from the chamber using a diaphragm pump. Prior to contact with the molecular sieve, chamber air is circulated through desiccant and ascarite traps to remove water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>, which compete for N<sub>2</sub>O on molecular sieve. We can demonstrate that N<sub>2</sub>O is absorbed onto molecular sieve and removed efficiently without sample loss or isotopic fractionation. Currently, we are in the chamber-testing phase and addressing field deployment and automation issues, we expect to conduct field trials this summer. This new chamber system has the potential to become a new tool for soil trace gas measurements that can be easily deployed in a variety of managed and natural ecosystems.

  abstract: "A major challenge in microbial ecology is to develop reliable methods of computer-assisted microscopy that can analyze digital images of complex microbial communities at single cell resolution, and compute useful ecological characteristics of their organization and structure in situ without cultivation. To address this challenge, our team of microbiologists, mathematicians and computer scientists have been developing image analysis software that can extract the full information content in digital images of actively growing microbial communities, thereby strengthening microscopy-based methods for understanding microbial ecology. Our system, called CMEIAS (Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System) contains image analysis and object classification plug-ins for UTHSCSA ImageTool running in Win NT4 / 2K / XPpro; stand-alone programs for color image segmentation, creating image quadrats, and cluster analysis of object feature measurements; action sequences to edit images of microbial communities in Adobe Photoshop; Excel addins to process and statistically analyze image analysis data, plus user manual documents, example images and interactive training tutorials.Our first release version (v1.27) of CMEIAS analyzes images, reports object counts, sizes and shapes, plus performs a supervised classification of all major plus several minor microbial morphotypes (equivalent to 98% of the genera in Bergey's Manual 9th ed.) in 14-dimensional space at frequencies of &gt; 0.1% with 97% accuracy, and is available for free download at our CMEIAS website &lt;http://cme.msu.edu/cmeias/&gt;. A CMEIAS ver. 1.28 upgrade is scheduled for release in Fall '06 and will feature new user support files including a fully-featured Help file, updated user manual and expanded training tutorials that have undergone major revision based on feedback from an international team of beta-testers.The CMEIAS v3.0 upgrade is at various stages of development. Its main structure is designed to extract 5 major ecologically relevant types of information from microbial communities in digital images: (i) classification of morphological diversity, using v1.27 algorithms combined with up to 42 additional measurement attributes of cell size, shape, luminance, and spatial distribution; (ii) microbial abundance, using cell size, counts, dilution adjusted concentration, hyphal length, cumulative biovolume, biomass C, biosurface area of the entire community or of each individual morphotype within the community; (iii) metabolic/physiological activity using differential color staining, (iv) autecology/phylogeny using color recognition with fluorescent molecular probes, and (v) spatial distribution, using numerous plotless, plot-based and geostatistical analysis parameters. CMEIAS output data are typically exported into MS Excel, EcoStat and GS+ Geostatistics to compute various ecological statistics that further characterize microbial community structure.Recent developments for CMEIAS v3.0 include:Four image processing tools to help prepare images for analysis. A stand-alone CMEIAS Color Segmentation program interactively samples color pixels of the foreground microbes of interest, then finds each cell&#8217;s boundary, and finally creates a new RGB \"object detected\" image containing these colored microbes in a noise-free background (96.7% accuracy). Its primary use will be to facilitate segmentation of foreground microbes of interest within RGB digital images where color differentiation really counts, e.g., immunofluorescence, FISH, activity/viability stains, Gram stains, etc. CMEIAS Action Palette Sequences operate in Adobe Photoshop / Image Processing ToolKit to semi-automate the editing of foreground and background pixels in phase contrast, fluorescence and SEM grayscale images of microbial communities (97.1% accuracy). A CMEIAS Object Separation Plugin operating in ImageTool automatically splits touching microbial cells within thresholded images (95.8% accuracy). A stand-alone CMEIAS Quadrat Maker application is being built to facilitate the optimizing of grid dimensions that divide an image into smaller, constant size quadrats for spatial sampling of microbial density, and then prepares images of each quadrat for plot-based and geostatistical spatial distribution analyses.Five statistical computation tools to process and analyze CMEIAS data extracted from images. Three of these tools operate within MS Excel(r) and the other two are stand-alone applications. The CMEIAS Action Performance Macro computes performance accuracy for newly developed action sequences by analyzing object analysis and morphotype classification data extracted from the corresponding edited images of microbes. The CMEIAS Data Preparation Macro compiles and concatenates CMEIAS object analysis and classification data, computes descriptive statistics, and automatically prepares the input tables of data for further analysis. The CMEIAS Data Analysis Addin performs frequency distribution analyses with user-selected bin parameters on object analysis data, analyzes object classification datasets built from multiple images to determine if the sample size is sufficient to estimate morphotype diversity, computes and plots a wide variety of diversity indices and similarity coefficients to evaluate and compare community structures, performs statistical inference tests, and analyzes plot-less, plot-based, and georeferenced data for spatial distribution analysis. Two stand-alone statistical analysis applications have been developed to perform cluster analysis on CMEIAS object analysis data in order to build the size border files that define the diversity of Operational Morphological Units recognized by the CMEIAS-3 classifier. The CMEIAS Upper Size Border tool performs a Monte Carlo cluster analysis to optimize the upper class limits for the user-defined size border file that is tailored for diversity analysis of the specific community being examined. The flexible design built into the user-defined size border file and these cluster analysis applications expands the ability of the CMEIAS-3 OMU classifier to recognize an almost unlimited range of diversity optimized for the community under investigation. The CMEIAS Hi-Low Size Border tool performs cluster analyses on population data extracted by CMEIAS and from Bergey's Manual database to build the general default size border file used for a wide variety of communities (not custom-tailored for any specific community).Additional notables in CMEIAS v.3.0: Eight out of 18 different Microbial Biovolume formulas have been identified as most accurate and implemented to measure this cell abundance parameter for all microbial morphotypes recognized by CMEIAS. A CMEIAS Cluster Index has been introduced to measure the proximity of aggregated cells surrounding each individual microbe as a Z variate for geostatistical spatial distribution analyses of colonization behavior. Several new CMEIAS measurement features of object analysis (Empirical Distribution, % Microbial Cover, Spatial Randomness, 1st and 2nd Nearest Neighbor Distances) have been added to analyze spatial distribution patterns of microbial colonization in situ. Mean Radius, Maximum Radius, and Aerial Porosity measurement feature attributes have been added to analyze microbial biofilm structure/development/function. A CMEIAS Script has been built to report the area of the AOI polygon for cumulative object analysis. Also a feature has been added to the CMEIAS Cumulative Object Analyzer that can assign the Cartesian coordinates for quadrat image posting centers that are weighted by the local density of objects within it or randomized for spatial analysis.Recent collaborative projects using CMEIAS include in situ analysis of the autecological biogeography of candidate biofertilizer inoculant strains of rhizobia that promote rice growth, microbial community analyses of corn leaf surfaces (normal vs. genetically engineered BT-corn), distribution and abundance of active communities within soil aggregates, seasonal succession of epilithic microbial biofilm communities in streambed rocks of Japanese freshwater streams, diversity of bacterioplankton in pristine Italian Alpine lakes, measurements of the in situ calling distances and spatial gradients for quorum sensing cell-to-cell communication during microbial colonization of roots, and the perturbations in microbial community structure associated with bacterial vaginosis.In summary, CMEIAS-based applications have potential for filling major gaps in our understanding of microbial ecology by providing accurate, robust and user-friendly computing tools that can extract ecologically important, quantitative information from digital images in situ at spatial scales relevant to the microbes themselves. It adds a powerful new dimension to examining microbial communities, and is especially valuable when combined with molecular-based and other methods of polyphasic analysis. These tools are admirably suited for microbial community analyses currently under investigation in this LTER program focused on row agriculture.

  abstract: "A recent study (Raymond and Cole 2003) examining the export of alkalinity via the Mississippi River and its tributaries to the ocean suggests that land cover has a significant impact on alkalinity export. The increase in carbon export was not accompanied by an increase in the acidity of atmospheric deposition, the latter having remained relatively constant over the study period. An analysis of the tributaries indicated a positive relationship between area of cropland and stream alkalinity, in contrast to forested sites which showed a strong negative relationship. Carbon exported to the ocean in the form of alkalinity may represent a previously overlooked and significant sequestration pathway.Ground limestone (&#8220;lime&#8221;) amendments, commonly applied in intensive agricultural settings, may be contributing to the alkalinity export and subsequent carbon sequestration noted by Raymond and Cole (2003). Limestone application represents an anthropogenic transport of carbon from geologic deposits to an actively cycling form that can potentially affect the exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere (Robertson et al. 2000). As agricultural ecosystems occupy an estimated 11% of the earth&#8217;s land surface, this has significant implications for the integrated greenhouse gas contribution of intensive agriculture.However, understanding the effect of liming on CO<sub>2</sub> trace gas fluxes is difficult as two alternative fates of lime amendments are plausible: strong acid weathering (source) and carbonic acid weathering (sink). The relative importance of these pathways is unknown. Data from the KBS LTER indicate that both reactions are taking place, and that certain treatment replicates favor the carbonic acid weathering pathway. The factors controlling which reaction pathway predominates are not yet fully understood, but it may be that adding more lime, rather than less, may lead to carbon sequestration by creating conditions that favor carbonic acid weathering."

  abstract: "Ongoing demographic and land use transformations in Southwestern counties in Michigan are presented as part of an effort to develop an integrated model of the human, agricultural and natural resource ecosystem. Demographic data of ten counties in the Region surrounding the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) are portrayed to examine the long-term changes in the social system, which will affect or be affected by soil, land and water conditions. Impacts on natural resources (forestry, fisheries and wildlife) are noted.The region in the 1950s had isolated urban cores (Battle Creek and Kalamazoo) surrounded by rural areas. Over the past 50 years, an urban corridor developed cutting across the Region. The growth of the urban corridor was facilitated primarily by the construction of major interstate highways in the Region. The urban corridor initially stimulated urban industrial growth in the counties, which in turned pushed up income. As a consequence, residential growth facilitated the spread of the corridor to outer areas, replacing agricultural land and areas used for forestry, fisheries and wildlife. Despite a relatively stable population, exurbanites continue to use agricultural land for their residences. Using data from the US Census of Population and the Census of Agriculture, the study examines: 1) how counties have been transformed during the past five decades, and 2) the spatial and temporal patterns of this transformation."

  abstract: We evaluated the effect of conventional, no-tillage, and low-input organic row crop agriculture and perennial farming systems on soil phosphorus (P). We also compared soil P under conventional agriculture to an adjacent forest site in south west Michigan, USA. Sequential fractionation analysis of soil inorganic and organic P fractions (Hedley et al. 1982) was performed on treatments 1 through 8 of the KBS LTER plots and the deciduous forest. Long-term conventional row crop agriculture resulted in the reduction of NaOH-extractable organic P by 79% compared to adjacent forested sites (<a href="Figures/daroub_tab1.htm">Table 1</a>). The calcium phosphate pool and the residual P fraction on the other hand increased under conventional agriculture compared to the forest site, probably due to fertilizer inputs. The adoption of no-tillage and low-input organic based systems for seven years did not significantly increase organic P in any of the fractions extracted from the annual cropping systems. However, organic P extracted by NaOH increased to 22.1% after the adoption of continuous alfalfa for the same period compared to 11.4% extracted in the conventional tillage treatment (<a href="Figures/daroub_fig1.htm">Fig. 1</a>). This increase was attributed to the turnover of the extensive alfalfa root system. The residual P content decreased under alfalfa cropping which suggests that alfalfa can take up P from this stable pool. Alfalfa may be tapping into this stable pool not just for P, but perhaps for Ca released through apatite dissolution. We conclude that continuous alfalfa can restore soils to their native P fertility levels by taking up P from the stable residual fraction and transforming it into moderately labile organic P through root death.

  abstract: The nature of the relationship between diversity and important ecosystem functions may have practical implications for agriculture. Observed relationships vary; however, most evidence suggests that at relatively low levels of diversity, increasing the number of species in a community should lead to increased productivity. Because of their low diversity, annual row-crop systems may be particularly sensitive to changes in the number of crop species. In this study we are investigating how increasing cropping-system diversity, through crop rotation and cover crops, affects crop yields in the absence of chemical inputs.

  abstract: "A major challenge in microbial ecology is to develop reliable methods of computer-assisted microscopy that can analyze digital images of complex microbial communities at single cell resolution, and compute useful ecological characteristics of their organization and structure <i>in situ</i> without cultivation. To address this challenge, our team of microbiologists, mathematicians and computer scientists have been developing image analysis software that can extract the full information content in digital images of actively growing microbial communities, thereby strengthening microscopy-based methods for understanding microbial ecology. Our system, called <b>CMEIAS</b> (<b><u>C</u></b>enter for <b><u>M</u></b>icrobial <b><u>E</u></b>cology <b><u>I</u></b>mage <b><u>A</u></b>nalysis <b><u>S</u></b>ystem) contains image analysis and object classification plug-ins for UTHSCSA ImageTool running in Win NT4.0/2000, stand-alone programs for image segmentation in color, making image quadrats, and cluster analysis of object feature measurements, action sequences to edit images of microbial communities in Adobe Photoshop, Excel macros to process and statistically analyze image analysis data, plus training tutorials and operator manual documents.Our first release version (v1.27) of CMEIAS analyzes images and reports object counts, sizes and shapes, plus performs a supervised classification of all major plus several minor microbial morphotypes (equivalent to 98% of the genera in Bergey's Manual 9th ed.) in 14-dimensional space at frequencies <u>&gt;</u> 0.1% with 97% accuracy, and is available at our CMEIAS website &lt;<a href=\"http://cme.msu.edu/cmeias/\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single\">http://cme.msu.edu/cmeias/</a>&gt;.The CMEIAS v3.0 upgrade is designed to extract 5 major ecologically relevant types of information from microbial communities in digital images: (i) classification of <b>morphological diversity</b>, using v1.27 algorithms combined with up to 42 additional measurement attributes of cell size, shape, luminance, and spatial distribution; (ii) <b>microbial abundance,</b> using cell size, counts, dilution adjusted concentration, hyphal length, cumulative biovolume, biomass C, biosurface area of the entire community or of each individual morphotype within the community; (iii) <b>metabolic/physiological activity</b> using differential color staining, (iv) <b>autecology/phylogeny</b> using color recognition with fluorescent molecular probes, and (v) <b>spatial distribution,</b> using numerous plotless, plot-based and geostatistical analysis parameters. CMEIAS output data are typically exported into MS Excel, EcoStat and GS+ Geostatistics to compute various ecological statistics that further characterize microbial community structure.Recent developments for CMEIAS v3.0 include:Four image processing tools to help prepare images for analysis. A stand-alone <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Color Recognition</b> program interactively samples color pixels of the foreground microbes of interest, then finds each cell&#8217;s boundary and finally creates a new RGB image with these colored microbes in a noise-free background (96.7% accuracy). Its primary use will be to facilitate segmentation of foreground microbes of interest within digital images where color differentiation really counts. <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Action Palette Sequences</b> operate in Adobe Photoshop /ImageProcessing ToolKit to semi-automate the editing of foreground and background pixels in phase contrast, fluorescence and SEM grayscale images of microbial communities (97.1% accuracy). A <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Object Separation</b> <b>Plugin</b> operating in ImageTool automatically splits touching microbial cells within binary images (95.8% accuracy). A stand-alone <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Quadrat Maker</b> program interactively divides an image into an optimized set of smaller quadrat mages for preparing image stacks used in plot-based spatial distribution analyses.Four statistical computation tools to process and analyze data extracted from images<span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: black\">.&nbsp;</span>Three macros have been prepared to work with acquired image analysis data imported into MS Excel. The <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Data Preparation</b> macro compiles, concatenates, performs descriptive statistics and graphically displays object analysis and classification data, preparing them for further analysis by ecological statistics. The <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Sampling Statistics</b> macro analyzes datasets containing multiple images to determine if the sample size is sufficient to estimate community morphotype diversity. The <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Action Performance</b> macro computes performance accuracy for newly developed action sequences by analyzing object analysis and morphotype classification data extracted from the corresponding edited images of microbes. A stand-alone <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Size Border</b> tool performs a Monte Carlo cluster analysis on object analysis datasets containing up to 42 user-selected measurement attributes of cell size, shape, luminosity, and/or local spatial attributes, and reports the information needed to build a statistically defendable, customized size border file that would define and classify all the diversity of Operational Morphological Units in a set of community images using the CMEIAS-3 classifier.Additional notables in CMEIAS v.3.0: Eight out of 18 different <b>Microbial Biovolume</b> formulas have been identified as most accurate and implemented to measure this cell abundance parameter for all microbial morphotypes recognized by CMEIAS. A <b>CMEIAS</b> <b>Cluster Index</b> has been introduced to measure the proximity of aggregated cells surrounding each individual microbe as a Z variate for geostatistical spatial distribution analyses of colonization behavior. <b>Mean Radius</b>, <b>Maximum Radius</b>, and <b>Aerial Porosity</b> measurement feature attributes have been added to analyze microbial biofilm structure/development/function. Several new CMEIAS measurement features of object analysis (Empirical Distribution, % Microbial Cover, Spatial Randomness, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Nearest Neighbor Distances) have been added to analyze spatial distribution patterns of microbial colonization <i>in situ</i>. A <b>CMEIAS Script</b> has been built to report the area of the AOI polygon for cumulative object analysis. Also a feature has been added to the <b>CMEIAS Cumulative Object Analyzer</b> that can assign the Cartesian coordinates for quadrat image posting centers that are weighted by the local density of objects within it or randomized for spatial analysis.Recent collaborative projects using CMEIAS include <i>in situ</i> analysis of the autecological biogeography of candidate biofertilizer inoculant strains of rhizobia that promote rice growth, microbial community analyses of corn leaf surfaces (normal vs. genetically engineered BT-corn), distribution and abundance of active communities within soil aggregates, seasonal succession of microbial biofilm communities in streambed rocks of Japanese freshwater streams, diversity of bacterioplankton in pristine Italian Alpine lakes, and measurements of the <i>in situ</i> calling distances and spatial gradients for quorum sensing cell-to-cell communication during microbial colonization of roots.In summary, CMEIAS-based applications have potential for filling major gaps in our understanding of microbial ecology by providing accurate, robust and user-friendly computing tools that can extract ecologically important, quantitative information from digital images <i>in situ</i> at spatial scales relevant to the microbes themselves. It adds a powerful new dimension to examining microbial communities, and is especially valuable when combined with molecular-based and other methods of polyphasic analysis.

  abstract: It has been estimated that compost and residue management can offset up to 50% of the radiative forces attributed to agriculture (Lal et al., 1998).&nbsp; The sequestration of C affects the mean residence time (MRT) of C and N in soil organic matter (SOM) pools and increases the size of SOM pools fostering ecosystem sustainability. The Living Field Lab (LFL) at the Kellogg Biological Station, begun in 1993, measures the interaction of crop rotation and cover crop use with compost or fertilizer applications on soil quality and productivity. Cropping treatments are continuous corn (CC) and a 4 y rotation, corn-corn-soybean-wheat (CCSW). Cover crops are crimson clover, red clover, and annual ryegrass. The fine- loamy, mixed, mesic typic haplaudalfs were sampled at a 0- 25 cm depth in 1993 and 1998 prior to tillage. Laboratory incubations indicated that the pool of potentially mineralizable organic N (N<sub>0</sub>) on compost treatments was 47 g N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil N in 1994 relative to 70 in 1998. The MRT of N more than doubled during 4 y of compost applications (246 to 768 d). Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub>-C respired to 150 d from the CC treatment with cover crop and compost, increased from 503 m g C g <sup>-1</sup> soil in 1994 to 580 in 1998. The CC treatment with cover crop and N fertilizer respired 656 m g C g<sup>-1</sup> soil in 1994 but only 579 in 1998. There were few differences between crops within the rotation. Incubation data are fit by non-linear regression to obtain slow and active pool size estimates and MRTs. The MRT of the slow pool is approximately 9 y. The slow pool constitutes 40% of the total soil C on average and is the pool that must be managed for C sequestration and sustainable agriculture. Many of the compost constituents have a field turn-over rate of several years and directly increase C sequestration.

  abstract: Growing concern over the potential loss of native biodiversity due to invasion by non-native species has resulted in a need for ecologists to better understand the relationship between community diversity and invasibility.&nbsp; A number of studies have investigated the relationship between species richness and invasibility at single points in time, but very few have examined the role of evenness, or the dynamics of these relationships across time.&nbsp; Kellogg Biological Station LTER provides a good system for quantifying such relationships, as species richness and abundance have been monitored over the past 14 years in old fields of varying ages.&nbsp; In this study, we examined relationships between community invasibility (changes in total and non-native species richness over time), invader impact (relative abundance of non-native species), species richness, biomass, and community evenness in successional communities at KBS.&nbsp; In early successional fields, total species richness has been increasing and evenness has been decreasing since the fields were last plowed in 1988, though the rates of invasion slowed after the first five years. Communities with high initial evenness had fewer non-native invasions and the higher native species richness over time, though evenness was not generally a good predictor of invasibility.&nbsp; In the three older successional fields, non-native abundance decreased while native species richness increased over ten years of monitoring. Evenness did not significantly change across the ten years.&nbsp; These patterns are in contrast to earlier studies that predicted that total species richness and evenness should increase with successional time, and that species richness, evenness, and invasibility are related in predictable ways. The identity and abundance of the dominant non-native species in this system, as well as past land use history, may explain some of the differences in relative invasibility and successional trajectories of these communities.

  abstract: Methane oxidation in soils is a small but significant sink of atmospheric methane; previous work has shown oxidation to be lower in agricultural than in native forest or prairie soils. We examined methane oxidation in two corn-corn-soybean-wheat cropping systems in southwest Michigan, one managed organically with compost and cover crop vs. one managed conventionally. Fluxes were measured once per month (non-growing season) or twice per month (growing season) with static chambers, and daily oxidation rates ranged from -20 to 17 &#181;g CH4-C/m2/h (negative fluxes indicate methane production, which occurred in some soils following heavy rainfall.) Overall we found little difference in overall oxidation rates between the two management systems. Rates of methane uptake varied somewhat by crop but only in organic cropping systems. Uptake rates were highest during the end of summer for both rotations, except during the transition of organic wheat into red clover. Average uptake was lowest in organic soybeans and organic wheat. Seasonal differences in oxidation rates may be related to differences in soil nitrogen availability.

Our research evaluates the importance of Ca and N for soil C stabilization. Incubations, using soil from an afforested pine stand with low soil C, were amended with lime (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and N separately and with litter. Nitrogen and CaCl<sub>2</sub> initially decreased CO<sub>2</sub> loss. Litter increased CO<sub>2</sub> evolution. Lime increased CO<sub>2</sub> evolution but less than that calculated for lime alone. Field plots amended with CaCl<sub>2</sub>, N and litter initially decreased CO<sub>2</sub> evolution. One year after treatment, field respiration was less from Ca and N treatments. Increasing soil Ca may maximize soil C sequestration through stabilization.

  abstract: <font size="2">Controls on <i>in situ</i> N<sub>2</sub>O production are very poorly understood in most ecosystems, and the global N<sub>2</sub>O budget is far from balanced. Environmental factors that affect N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes are well-studied, but are poor predictors of measured rates. An untested contributor to systematic variation in N<sub>2</sub>O production is denitrifier population diversity. Pure culture studies have shown that relative rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production (N<sub>2</sub>O/(N<sub>2</sub>O+N<sub>2</sub>)) among denitrifier populations grown under identical conditions can differ substantially (1-3), which suggests that the composition of the denitrifying community in soils may be an important control on N<sub>2</sub>O production <i>in situ</i>. We are testing whether denitrifier population diversity is important to potential rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production in geomorphically identical soils that differ in C, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, pH, and moisture.</font><font size="2">We sampled soil from a corn field and a never-tilled successional field (KBS LTER treatments 1 and 8). Soil organic C is different between these two ecosystems due to tillage and long-term differences in plant communities. The composition of the denitrifying community, as characterized using fatty acid profiles of isolated bacteria, was also different between the two ecosystems.</font><font size="2">We tested whether these differences in populations are functionally significant using a soil slurry technique in which all factors that control relative rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production by denitrifiers -- other than denitrifier community composition -- are controlled (pH, O2, denitrifier enzyme status) or provided in non-limiting quantities (C, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Denitrifier enzymes were first induced by preincubating soil slurries anaerobically. An incubation was then initiated by adding 0.1 ml of a C and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> solution to final concentrations of 1 mM, and oxygen to various final concentrations between 0 and 1% in the headspace. Acetylene, which blocks the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub>, was added to half the vials and N<sub>2</sub>O production was monitored in all vials during a 40 min incubation. As expected, N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were highest when acetylene was added to vials and generally decreased with increasing oxygen concentration, regardless of the presence of acetylene. At native pH, there was a significant difference in the relative rate of N<sub>2</sub>O production for these two soils at all O<sub>2</sub> concentrations tested. These differences disappeared when CaCO<sub>3</sub> was added to soils to adjust pH to 7.0. These results indicate either that different populations are active in each site or that the same community is present in both soils and their N<sub>2</sub>O response is pH sensitive. Current experiments are designed to separate possible pH effects from population effects.</font>

  abstract: "Digital color imaging for quantitative image analysis is a potentially powerful methodology for studies of in situ microbial ecology, but the technology needed to fully utilize this approach is at a rudimentary stage. The color pixels that comprise microbes in RGB images can be used to differentiate their Gram\x92s reaction, (live/dead) membrane integrity, metabolic activity, phylogeny, and autecological biogeography. Spatial position, morphological diversity and abundance of microbes are other important in situ ecological features that can potentially be extracted from color images of microbial communities. However, one faces several major problems in editing digital color images of microbes before image analysis, including the presence of complex, noisy backgrounds, pixels of foreground objects of interest that vary significantly in their RGB values, microbes containing internal dark pixels with RGB values included in background, and bright halos of background pixels surrounding cell contours. Because various combinations of these problems may exist in images containing a high density of microbes, much time must be spent manually editing them before one can start to extract useful information. Various image processing routines are available that provide a simple color threshold based on sampling only a single color pixel. But this approach most frequently fails to segment most foreground microbes of interest because of the problems stated above. Here we introduce a new CMEIAS Color Recognition program that addresses these major image editing problems in order to segment the colored microbes of interest. Our approach uses color recognition, i.e., classification of pixels based on the color information from the digitized color image, to identify different selected regions representing the microbes of interest. The novelty of this new system is the interactive environment of the sampling module, where the user can zoom in and select multiple target pixels from many cells in order to segment the foreground regions of interest in a confusing background. The system applies the RGB information from the selected set of multiple color pixels to a region-growing algorithm that finds the boundary of the foreground objects. Additionally, various routine image processing and computer vision algorithms, e.g., image smoothing, sharpening, closing, edge detection, color dilation and erosion, are included to enhance the output of the edited color image. Bacteria colored by different molecular probes can also be segmented individually in the same microbial community image. We propose that color segmentation achieved by this new CMEIAS program provides an efficient first stage of image editing, and anticipate that the operating principal of this tool will open many new opportunities for quantitative image analysis of microbes in digital color images. However, as with all applications of digital image analysis, color images of the microbial community must be of high quality as a prerequisite. Our first application of this CMEIAS Color Recognition program, illustrated in our other CMEIAS poster for this meeting, was to produce segmented color images for analysis of the spatial distribution of color-coded bacteria that provide a source of quorum sensing cell communication molecules in situ during their colonization of plant roots"

  abstract: "The uniformity, low cost and ease of application associated with inorganic fertilizers have diminished the use of organic nutrient sources. Concern for food safety, the environment and the need to dispose of animal and municipal wastes have focused attention on organic sources of N such as animal derived amendments, green manures, and crop rotations. Providing nutrients to row crops from organic sources demands intensive management of the N and C cycles. Managing organic N sources to provide sufficient N at the grand phase of crop growth requires knowledge of C and N decomposition over several years particularly where manure and compost is applied. Management practices of this trial included: a comparison of compost and chemical fertilizer, use of a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation compared to continuous corn and the addition of a cover crop within each cropping system. Soil samples were taken in April prior to tillage from a 0-25 cm depth in the 2<sup>nd</sup> (1994) and 6<sup>th</sup> year (1998) of the experiment. Nitrogen (150 d) and C incubations (320 d) were conducted to determine the effect of cropping system and nutrient management on: N mineralization potential (NMP), the mineralizable organic N pool (No), the mean residence time (MRT) of No, C mineralization (C<sub>min</sub>), and soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and fluxes. Compost applications increased the resistant pool of C by 30% and the slow pool of C by 10%. The compost treatment contained 10% greater soil organic C than the fertilizer management. Nitrogen was limiting on all compost treatments with the exception of 1<sup>st</sup> y corn following wheat fallow and clover cover crop. The added diversity of the clover cover crop and wheat-fallow increased inorganic N in both nutrient managements. We recommend that growers adjust their N fertilizer recommendation to reflect the quantity and timing of N mineralized from organic N sources. Proper management of nutrients from compost, cover crops and rotations can maintain soil fertility, improve soil quality, and increase C sequestration."

  abstract: This essay traces the history of land use in western Michigan, defined here as the Saint Joseph, Kalamazoo, and Grand River valleys. It treats the history of land use as a function of shifts over time in economic systems--the values and behavior structuring the ways that people secure their livelihoods. The logic of treating the river valleys as a regional unit of analysis is that they are part of the Carolinian biotic province and share a common Native American, European, and Euro-American settlement history. The essay first characterizes a Native American semi-migratory, subsistence economy from the early seventeenth century on the eve of European contact. Although it proved highly durable in its essentials, this economy was nevertheless shaped from the late seventeenth century on by the Indians' involvement in the fur trade and, by the 1830s, by the arrival of white settlers who eventually displaced most native peoples from western Michigan. In the generation before the Civil War, these settlers practiced an economy known as subsistence plus surplus. The term signals the importance of long-distance trade in this economy, yet emphasizes that production for market does not outweigh household and communal securing of the necessities of life. There were certain similarities on the frontier in western Michigan between this economy and the Native American economy as it had been shaped by the fur trade. By 1860, however, the displacement of native peoples was complete. A transportation system capable of carrying bulk goods cheaply and rapidly east was in place, and capital investments in frontier farms were sufficiently great to transform western Michigan into a region dedicated to commercial mixed farming.

Existing natural enemy communities known to contribute to <i>A. glycines</i> population regulation in Michigan soybeans include almost exclusively predators, and there are relatively few records of parasitoids, most of them occurring in the highly diverse context of the KBS-LTER Biodiversity Plots, Hickory Corners, Michigan.&nbsp; During 2004 we conducted a field experiment to evaluate the joint impact of predators and parasitoids on <i>A. glycines</i> populations and to examine the role of predators in limiting parasitoid impacts via intraguild predation (IGP).&nbsp; The experiment was performed using natural parasitoid populations in the KBS-LTER site.&nbsp; Using tomato cage frames covered in mesh we differentially excluded all natural enemies (&lt; 1 mm mesh, Aphid treatment) or only large predators (2 mm mesh, Mesh treatment), thus allowing natural parasitism to occur.&nbsp; We also included un-caged plants with and without aphid manipulation (Open and Field treatments), plants enclosed with a sham cage (Sham treatment) as a cage control, and plants caged without aphids (Plant treatment). Soybean aphid populations were regulated throughout the season by the assemblage of natural enemies, resulting in a trophic cascade that increased plant height. Small size predators and parasitoids did not prevent aphid peak populations (Mesh treatment), but delayed them for approximately two weeks in comparison with predator exclusion treatments, and this also resulted in a trophic cascade that increased plant height. We observed evidence of IGP by large predators, reaching approximately 30% of mummies eaten in some cases. Parasitism was higher within cages providing refuge from IGP by large predators, but did not reach high levels and appears to not be responsible for aphid population reduction.

  abstract: <font size="2">Controls on <i>in situ</i> N<sub>2</sub>O production are very poorly understood in most ecosystems, and the global N<sub>2</sub>O budget is far from balanced. Environmental factors that affect N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes are well-studied, but are poor predictors of measured rates. An untested contributor to systematic variation in N<sub>2</sub>O production is denitrifier population diversity. Pure culture studies have shown that relative rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production (N<sub>2</sub>O/(N<sub>2</sub>O+N<sub>2</sub>)) among denitrifier populations grown under identical conditions can differ substantially (1-3), which suggests that the composition of the denitrifying community in soils may be an important control on N<sub>2</sub>O production <i>in situ</i>. We are testing whether denitrifier population diversity is important to potential rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production in geomorphically identical soils that differ in C, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, pH, and moisture.</font><font size="2">We sampled soil from a corn field and a never-tilled successional field (KBS LTER treatments 1 and 8). Soil organic C is different between these two ecosystems due to tillage and long-term differences in plant communities. The composition of the denitrifying community, as characterized using fatty acid profiles of isolated bacteria, was also different between the two ecosystems.</font><font size="2">We tested whether these differences in populations are functionally significant using a soil slurry technique in which all factors that control relative rates of N<sub>2</sub>O production by denitrifiers -- other than denitrifier community composition -- are controlled (pH, O2, denitrifier enzyme status) or provided in non-limiting quantities (C, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Denitrifier enzymes were first induced by preincubating soil slurries anaerobically. An incubation was then initiated by adding 0.1 ml of a C and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> solution to final concentrations of 1 mM, and oxygen to various final concentrations between 0 and 1% in the headspace. Acetylene, which blocks the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub>, was added to half the vials and N<sub>2</sub>O production was monitored in all vials during a 40 min incubation. As expected, N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were highest when acetylene was added to vials and generally decreased with increasing oxygen concentration, regardless of the presence of acetylene. At native pH, there was a significant difference in the relative rate of N<sub>2</sub>O production for these two soils at all O<sub>2</sub> concentrations tested. These differences disappeared when CaCO<sub>3</sub> was added to soils to adjust pH to 7.0. These results indicate either that different populations are active in each site or that the same community is present in both soils and their N<sub>2</sub>O response is pH sensitive. Current experiments are designed to separate possible pH effects from population effects.</font>

  abstract: "Cultivation of previously undisturbed soils commonly results in the loss of 40-60% of initial C and N from surface horizons. In the tropics losses typically occur within months of cultivation, but a lack of data for temperate ecosystems prevents similar generalizations on a time scale less than about five years. We investigated changes in soil C pools, aggregation, nitrous oxide fluxes and denitrification in the first sixty days following cultivation of a previously untilled mid-successional community in southwest Michigan. Additionally, we designed a litter removal experiment to determine whether immediate, measurable changes were due to acceleration of soil organic matter dynamics or the incorporation of above-ground plant biomass and litter. Cultivation had an immediate impact on all measured properties: within two weeks we found differences in dissolved organic carbon, inorganic N, trace gas fluxes, and field-moist aggregates. A decline in water-stable aggregates coupled with a shift in the distribution of inter- and intra-aggregate light fraction organic matter likely contributed to changes in carbon dioxide fluxes. Increased nitrous oxide fluxes following cultivation were closely related to increases in N availability. Cultivation also reduced denitrification enzymes, probably due to rapid aggregate turnover which reduced the frequency and persistence of anaerobic microsites. Sites where above-ground plant biomass and litter were removed prior to cultivation had trace gas fluxes that were higher than in control sites but lower than in plots where above-ground resources were incorporated with cultivation. The rapid changes in nutrient mobilization observed here have implications for understanding the historical impact of agricultural expansion and for mitigating that impact via soil C sequestration and other means."

  abstract: In conventional agricultural systems, nitrogen fertilizer can stimulate N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes whereas N inputs to forested systems often do not. At the Kellogg Biological Station we have examined N<sub>2</sub>O production in conifer and deciduous forests that have been fertilized with 0 or 30 kg N/ha/yr. From the outset of the experiment N<sub>2</sub>O production was greater in the conifer than in the deciduous stands. In the first year of the experiment N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were similar in fertilized and control plots for each forest type. After six years of fertilization, fertilized forest plots in both stand types produced more N<sub>2</sub>O than did the unfertilized control plots. We hypothesize that the reason for the time lag in the N<sub>2</sub>O response to fertilization is the accumulation of organic matter in the forest floor that buffers the forested system from inputs of N. In initial tests of this hypothesis we transferred intact conifer forest floor into conventional agricultural systems. We monitored surface N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from soil with and without forest floor additions. Forest floor material was also combined with agricultural soil in laboratory experiments to determine whether organic matter from the forested systems depresses N<sub>2</sub>O production when fertilizer is added to soils.&nbsp; Contrary to expectations, forest floor additions stimulated rather than reduced N<sub>2</sub>O production in agricultural soils both in the field and in the laboratory. In a separate experiment, when forest floor leachates were added both with and without fertilizer to agricultural soil, N<sub>2</sub>O production was stimulated only by conifer forest floor leachate with fertilizer. Experiments are now underway to define the mechanisms responsible for the stimulation of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes when forest floor material is introduced to the agricultural systems.

All participants are involved in the partnership over the course of three years with the understanding that educational reform is a long-term endeavor. Seventy teachers from 15 rural school districts attend workshops and summer institutes and meet regularly with advanced ecology Ph.D. students with the goal of improving science classroom instruction and teacher understanding of science content. The science is rooted in ecosystem ecology, based directly on five research areas studied by Long Term Ecological Research sites: primary productivity, decomposition, populations and trophic levels, nutrient cycling, and disturbances. This ecosystem framework is used to connect science concepts across disciplines and to link science teaching to ongoing scientific research. After two years, our approach has facilitated the most change in teacher understanding of science content and classroom teaching practice. In our first set of week-long summer institutes, teachers engaged in scientific study of local ecosystems and developed individual research projects in order to acquire a firsthand understanding of science inquiry. The ecological study and research project helped teachers develop instructional units to implement in their classrooms during the coming school year. Most teachers implemented their instructional units, oftentimes with critical assistance from ecology Ph.D. students. The school year workshops serve to introduce and reinforce ecosystem concepts and further explore inquiry-based science, assessment, and components of teaching for understanding."

  abstract: The Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX) is an NSF-funded cross-site comparison study that includes streams at several LTER sites across North America. The KBS site is Eagle Creek, located near Augusta in Ross Township. At each site we performed whole-stream <sup>15</sup>N enrichment experiments for six weeks, following standardized protocols. The <sup>15</sup>N was added as ammonium at levels that did not produce a fertilizing effect. The <sup>15</sup>N enrichment revealed nitrogen flow through aquatic food webs as well as molecular transformations mediated by microbial activity (e.g., nitrification). All ten experiments were conducted in 1997 and 1998, and the LINX group is presently working on data analysis and publication of the results.Eagle Creek is one of the largest and most nutrient-rich streams among the LINX sites. In short-term nutrient additions (N or P), uptake from the stream water could not be detected over a 500-m reach. Nutrient-diffusing substrates did not stimulate algal growth, suggesting that low light availability due to canopy shading limits primary production within the stream more than nutrients do. Thus the stream would appear to act as a conduit for nutrients. However, the d <sup>15</sup>N of dissolved ammonium and nitrate changed markedly over the reach, revealing that these labile nutrients exist in a dynamic steady-state in which ammonium is being produced and nitrified, and nitrate is being assimilated and/or denitrified, thus maintaining stable concentrations.Aquatic invertebrates in the creek, which are diverse and abundant, became labeled with <sup>15</sup>N to varying degrees depending on their food sources and growth and turnover rates. Insect larvae that scrape algae from hard substrates became most labeled, followed by invertebrates known to be benthic particle feeders. Filter feeders became only slightly labeled. The <sup>15</sup>N enrichment was harder to detect in animals with the slowest turnover (fishes and clams), but measurements of the digestive gland of the clams did reveal isotopic enrichment.The results of this experiment show the relative importance of algal assimilation vs. microbial transformations in determining the fate of nitrogen in the stream, and provide a comprehensive picture of food-web linkages and the relative roles of autochthonous primary production and allochthonous litter inputs in supporting stream food webs leading to fishes.

  abstract: A nematode community structure standard for Michigan, using absolute and relative population densities was developed from two research projects for comparative analysis of natural and human-managed ecosystems.&nbsp; KBS LTER and LFL 1996-1999 data are being used as independent data sets for model validation.&nbsp; The absolute densities of the standard for woodlot, old field succession, certified organic and conventional agriculture systems are 500, 1,700, 3,500 and 200 per 100 cm<sup>3</sup> soil, respectively. The components for the relative densities are bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores, omnivores, carnivores and algavores.&nbsp; Major differences in relative densities exist among the four types of ecosystems.&nbsp; Spring and fall nematode community structure of KBS-LTER old field succession one-year, 10-years and 30-years post disturbance were highly correlated with the standard. &nbsp;In general, absolute population densities associated with the KBS-LFL (conventional monoculture, conventional rotation, integrated compost and organic) were significantly less than those associated with the old-field successions and were a good fit with the conventional standard, regardless of the type of KBS production system management. Fall relative densities of bacterivores were higher in the LFL organic system compared to conventional corn monoculture. &nbsp;Absolute population densities of herbivores were higher in the LFL conventional compared organic system.&nbsp; The temporal dynamics of the absolute population densities varied among growing seasons, but were always lowest in the summer and higher in the spring and fall.&nbsp; In general, KBS LTER and LFL data provide at least partial validation of the 2006 Michigan Nematode Community Structure Standard.Back to Poster Titles

  abstract: Soil aggregation processes and wetting-drying cycles modify micro-habitats by changing pore networks and sequestering carbon (C) within newly formed microsites within interiors of aggregates.&nbsp; Morphotype analyses of bacterial communities within concentric layers of soil aggregates can be used to estimate bacterial populations associated with these micro-habitats located on surfaces and within the central regions of macroaggregates.&nbsp; Bacterial morphotypes were identified by computer image processing software developed by the Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System (CMEIAS) at Michigan State University.&nbsp; Bacteria were extracted from exterior and interior regions of soil aggregates by mechanical soil aggregation erosion (SAE) chambers and stained with DTAF (5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl) aminofluorescein).&nbsp; Diversity and the number of bacteria were compared with C concentrations.&nbsp; Soil C contents identified on aggregate exteriors were 12% and 3% greater than interior regions of macro-aggregates sampled from native forest (NF) and conventionally tilled (CT) agroecological soils at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) LTER site and the Upper Peninsula (UP) research sites.&nbsp; Increased numbers of bacteria per gram of soil were observed in the exterior regions of soil aggregates from the KBS loam (6.24E10 in exterior, 5.25E10 in interior) and UP sandy loam soils (4.98E10 in exterior, 4.66E10 in interior).&nbsp; Although extraction and staining protocols for identifying soil bacteria have been developed, the anticipated greater quantities of bacterial morphotypes located within exterior regions of soil aggregates could not be observed by the CEMIAS evaluations of stained soil layers extracted from aggregates.&nbsp; However, direct relationships between C concentrations and extracted bacteria per gram of soil were observed.

  abstract: Soil organic matter dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions generated by row-crop systems under various management schemes have been investigated intensively for over a decade at the Kellogg Biological Station&#8217;s Long-Term Ecological Research (KBS LTER) site.&nbsp; Recent synthesis of this information permitted estimation of the global warming potential of various row-crop management systems (Robertson et al. 2000), and revealed that soil amendments of &#8220;lime&#8221; [usually limestone CaCO<sub>3</sub> or dolomite CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] appear to play a major role in the carbon budgets of Midwestern agricultural soils.&nbsp; Massive amounts of carbonate minerals are mined and spread over agricultural soils to counteract acidification, and this represents a major yet overlooked anthropogenic flux of carbon associated with intensive agriculture.&nbsp; Robertson et al.'s calculations assumed that the inorganic carbon in these minerals eventually becomes carbon dioxide as the lime is consumed, yet in fact the fate of this material is not clear.&nbsp; New measurements of soil solution chemistry in experimental treatments at the KBS LTER suggest that added lime can act as either a source or a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide depending on the biogeochemical reactions in the upper meter of soil (especially those affecting the acid-base chemistry).&nbsp;New research is being planned that will investigate the fate of lime amendments in conventional row cropping systems to determine whether they result in a net source or sink for carbon dioxide, and to discover the mechanisms that are involved.&nbsp; Our global hypothesis follows:Differences across treatments in the rate and nature of reaction of lime with the soil solution are explained primarily by acidifying reactions mediated by microbes in association with various plant-soil systems, and particularly by differences in rates of nitrification associated with fertilization or nitrogen fixation.&nbsp; A reduction in the rate of acidifying processes and/or an increase in the availability of lime in the soil will shift the net carbon balance associated with liming from a CO<sub>2</sub> source to a CO<sub>2</sub> sink via the promotion of carbonic acid weathering.&nbsp;One way to examine this hypothesis is through controlled experimental additions of lime to cropping systems at the KBS LTER site.&nbsp; We are currently evaluating the options for such experiments and planning for the collection of pre-liming data.&nbsp; The experiments would entail monitoring soil solution chemistry over several years following the lime addition.&nbsp; Ideally, the loss of carbon and other elements from the soil profile via gas emissions, infiltrating waters, and harvest of crops will be monitored, and the inorganic carbon remaining in the soil profile will be measured.&nbsp; This would allow construction of a mass-balance budget for the carbon added as lime.&nbsp; In addition, a suite of biogeochemical variables should be measured to construct an acid-base budget for the soil profile, which will reveal the major chemical and biological processes that control the dissolution of lime and the fate of the resultant solutes.&nbsp; This would reveal the fate of lime amendments under tillage and no-till management and also examine how interactions between lime and N fertilization determine the ultimate fate of the carbon in the lime.&nbsp;If the hypothesis proves to be supported, then management options to ameliorate the global warming potential associated with the widespread use of limestone amendments could be considered, and these might be easier to implement than options to enhance soil carbon storage.&nbsp; Such options may entail adding <i>more</i> lime rather than less because the dominant reaction of lime dissolution at circumneutral pH -- carbonic acid weathering -- actually sequesters soil carbon dioxide as bicarbonate, which is then subject to transport downward by infiltrating waters.&nbsp;

  abstract: Agronomic yield is evaluated for each of the annually tilled cropping systems each year. The annual cropped systems are in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation. The annual cropped treatments are replicated six times and include Treatment 1, CT-Conventional Chemical Input/Conventional Tilled, Treatment 2, NT-Conventional Chemical Input/No Tillage, Treatment 3, LI-Low Chemical Input/Conventional Tillage, and Treatment 4, ZI-ZeroChemical Input/Conventional Tillage. Differences in cropping systems and how each is managed influence final grain yield (Fig. 1). &nbsp; Since 1996 grain yields on the LTER site have been estimated using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS uses 24 earth orbiting satellites to determine the JD 4425 Combines location during the harvesting operation with sub-meter accuracy. The coordinates are added to yield information in 1 second intervals and this data is used to generate yield maps following the harvesting operation. The yield monitor within the combine is connected to various electronic sensors within the combine and is calibrated prior to harvest for each crop. The yield monitor gives accurate on the go information to the combine operator during the harvest operation and this data is recorded and downloaded to a computer at the end of each harvest day. In 1998, all four treatments were evaluated for wheat yield across all six replicates; grain weights compared to actual grain weight by plot had generally less than 2% error. In 1996-corn and 1997-soybean harvests, the first four replicates of all four treatments were recorded (some of reps 5 and 6) using the yield monitor. The 1996 yield monitor data has been corrected for moisture and grain yield by plot and re-mapped. The 1997 data is still being processed and we&#8217;re just beginning to look at the 1998 data. The JD 4425 combine will be available for demonstration and yield maps for Treatment 3, Replicate 3 for 1996-corn, 1997-soybean, and 1998-wheat appear in Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3. These maps demonstrate similar yield treads for a location and across years for different crops. These similarities show how changes in soil type influences final grain yields and these differences can also be picked up by looking at the low level infared fly-over photographs taken each year prior to harvest.Return to Contents

  abstract: We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime -- a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field (KBS LTER treatments 1 and 8, respectively). We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production [DN2O/(DN2O+N2)], or rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN2O differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. These differences suggest that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner. We also found evidence of differential regulation of denitrification enzymes among denitrifiers isolated from these same two soils. We isolated 93 denitrifying bacteria from treatment 1 and 63 from treatment 8 soils. Cluster analysis of cellular fatty acid profiles of these isolates revealed two levels of taxonomic clustering at which the two communities differed. For example, the four numerically dominant isolates from each soil were rare or not present in the other soil. We measured the sensitivity of nos enzyme, which is responsible for the reduction of N2O to N2, for representative isolates from 20 taxa. There was great diversity in the degree of sensitivity to oxygen among isolates. Since culturing bacterial isolates under one set of conditions tends to select for organisms with similar characteristics, this level of physiological diversity probably represents a conservative estimate of that which exists in situ. This diversity provides a physiological basis for community-level differences in nos sensitivity to oxygen that could result in ecosystem-level effects of denitrifier community composition. Understanding soil N2O flux may require a better understanding of the role of denitrifier diversity on this important ecosystem function.Return to Contents

  abstract: The removal of nitrogen (N) by wetlands and streams is of particular interest because excessive nitrate is a growing water quality problem. Most research on N removal has focused on plant or microbial uptake (assimilation) or respiratory denitrification by bacteria. The increasing application of stable isotope and other tracer techniques to study N removal has yielded a growing body of evidence for other microbial processes that involve the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) or the chemoautotrophic denitrification of nitrate to dinitrogen. In this talk, we present evidence for the existence and importance of these novel N removal pathways in freshwaters, and consider how they might change our perspectives on N removal.

  abstract: One of the main ways in which environments interact at the landscape scale is through the fluxes of water by surface and subsurface pathways. Lakes, wetlands, and streams are abundant and diverse in the glacial landscape around KBS and represent an important recreational and aesthetic resource (Fig. 2.14). The central question we intend to address with our new landscape biogeochemistry component is "How do current and future land use and landscape patterns affect the fluxes of water and nutrients from upland areas to lakes, streams and wetlands?" Our studies of land-water linkages will benefit from the detailed understanding of terrestrial ecosystems provided by previous LTER research, as well as an extensive body of limnological research on local lakes and streams.We will measure hydrochemistry (major solutes and nutrients) at key points along hydrological flow paths, beginning with precipitation and including infiltrating soil water, ground waters, springs, streams, wetlands, and lakes (Fig. 2.14). The study area is defined as a watershed subunit that encompasses the LTER site and is bounded by Gull Lake on the west and Augusta Creek on the east (Fig. 2.14). Sampling will be performed over several years to reveal both seasonal and interannual variability. Spatially-explicit hydrogeological models will be employed to determine flow paths and transit times for subsurface water movement, as well as to simulate the loading of pollutants from various landscape units. In the future, changes in land use and landscape patterns associated with the increasing conversion of rural land to residential use will alter the magnitudes and relative proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from the land surface to lakes, streams, and wetlands. In addition, climate change will affect the water balance, most likely leading to dryer conditions during the growing season and decreased water tables. Our comprehensive understanding of water and nutrient fluxes across the local landscape will reveal how surface and subsurface water resources are impacted by these changes.Return to Contents

  abstract: "<font size=\"2\">Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) at KBS was in its seventh cropping year in 1995. Four annual agronomic cropping systems, rotated into winter wheat from soybeans in a corn- (93) soybean (94) -wheat (95) rotation sequence. Agronomic annual cropping inputs for winter wheat was evaluated across six replicates on four different input systems. A perennial cropping system was also evaluated across six replicates for a second year alfalfa stand for yield in 1995.</font><font size=\"2\">The annual cropping systems were planted to Chelsea winter wheat in mid-October using a John Deere no till drill in 1994. These treatments included conventional till (CT) wheat (Treatment 1) and no till (NT) wheat (Treatment 2) and had agronomic inputs applied based on best management practices (BMP). Based on soil tests taken late fall in 1994, 50 lb. N/A as ammonium nitrate (34-0-0), inorganic Nitrogen fertilizer application applied over the top in early spring using a Gandy Orbit Air Spreader and both treatments were sprayed with 2,4-D amine at a 1 pt/A rate for broadleaf weed control. A conventional broadcast sprayer was used to apply the herbicide treatment across six replicates of the conventional till and no till treatments.</font><font size=\"2\">Two reduced agronomic input annual cropping systems were also evaluated. These were also planted to Chelsea winter wheat, however were treated with lower than BMP inputs levels. These included a Low Chemical Input wheat (Treatment 3), having a 30 lb. N/A as ammonium nitrate (34-0-0), inorganic Nitrogen fertilizer application. No herbicide application was done to this treatment in 1995. The Zero Chemical Input wheat (Treatment 4) did not have any herbicide or fertilizer applications in 1995 and is consistent with previous years treatments. Low Chemical Input (Treatment 3) and Zero Chemical Input (Treatment 4) wheat treatments were frost seeded to Mammoth Red Clover in mid-March and allowed to grow throughout the season as a cover crop to symbiotically fix nitrogen, increase organic matter (OM) levels, and increased soil structure properties. Mean yields for Chelsea wheat was 45.4 bu/A, averaged across all replicates and treatments in 1995.</font><font size=\"2\">Treatments 1-3 did not yield significantly different from each other in 1995. Mean yields for TRT 1-3 was 49.6 bu/A. Treatment 4, the zero chemical input wheat had a mean yield of 32.6 bu/A. As expected, TRT 4 was significantly lower yielding than the other treatments.</font><font size=\"2\">Agronomic Protocols and Yields can be viewed on the LTER World Wide Web Home Page: WWW: http://kbs.msu.edu/lter/home.html.

Key points of integration include chemical, biological, geomorphological and social dimensions. Research on social dimensions in LTER will provide for a better understanding of the factors that influence the adoption and incorporation of different management practices and how human populations evaluate these changes in relation to the environmental impact of agriculture on rural resources.Both natural and social systems have histories, and the essence of LTER is to mark changes in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Shifts in social dimensions that have long term impacts on agricultural and natural resource ecosystems, especially at the KBS LTER site, will be examined.

  abstract: We used a Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework to simulate corn yield in the Upper Midwest Region from 1972 to 1990. The model used in this study, which was developed by Muchow and Sinclair, simulates daily maize growth and productivity based on daily weather inputs. Although this model is site specific it has regional application potential and can be adapted for its use in cold climates. We included in the model a variable to account for water availability an algorithm for cold temperature correction.&nbsp; Model outputs were compared with actual yields based on USDA-NASS databases. The application of the temperature correction increased the simulated corn yields with the coldest spring years having the greatest increases. The inclusion of the water availability information resulted in much smaller changes. Large simulated increases in corn yields (30-40%) occurred under water saturation conditions. In 1988 (drought year) the simulation model predicted corn yields more accurately than in 1990. One reason for the higher correlation between model predictions and actual yields in 1988 may be that under conditions of high yield and high water availability, stresses other than lack of water such as disease or insect will play a larger role in reducing simulated corn yields.

  abstract: Soil samples collected at normal sampling scales may contain numerous microbial habitats defined by a unique assemblage of species.&nbsp; This could mask the responses of microbial communities to changes in the environment as well as cause the high species richness and evenness detected in soil bacterial ribosomal clone libraries.&nbsp; We hypothesized that physical soil fractions that have been shown to differ chemically from each other would contain different eubacterial communities.&nbsp; In addition, different plant communities/soil management regimes will select for a different subset of species within each habitat, amounting to unique communities within each habitat-management regime combinations.&nbsp; Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S ribosomal gene was used to characterize dominant community members in each soil fraction sample.&nbsp; There was no community differentiation between&nbsp; community profiles of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6.3 mm aggregates of their internal and external layers.&nbsp; Light fraction, shoot residue, and rhizosphere communities were distinct from heavy fraction communities.&nbsp; Alfalfa soil eubacterial communities were different from conventional, continuous corn soil bacterial communities in all soil fractions.&nbsp; Organic rotation corn soil communities were more variable and were divided between the groups created by communities under monoculture.&nbsp; We have shown that soil fractions defined by unique physical and chemical characteristics can harbor unique eubacterial communities, although not all soil fractions proved to be distinct habitats as hypothesized.&nbsp; The samples from soil taken under continuous plant monocultures show that the resources and disturbance regimes presented by different plant species and soil management practices can also cause divergence in species assemblages.&nbsp; Both habitat diversity and plant diversity have the potential to increase bacterial species richness and evenness found in soil, and this is reflected in the increased variability in the organic rotation corn soil communities.

  abstract: "Our research goal was to gain an understanding of the social and economic factors that contribute to the spatial and temporal variation in the soil carbon dynamics of agricultural ecosystems in the U.S. Midwest. Our working hypothesis was that soil carbon dynamics are affected by 1) social and economic structure and 2) agronomic management (see figure one).Through visual surveys, and mail and telephone surveys, the row crop operators in the four townships surrounding the KBS LTER were identified. Preliminary data on social and economic structure and agronomic management was collected from the row crop operators.Our first hypothesis was that growers use relatively simple management heuristics for making agronomic decisions. The data collected did not uphold this hypothesis. The management heuristic for each farm varied in its level of complexity, as well as in its form. This made the process of grouping farms by similar inputs, tillage systems and cropping sequences impossible and matching farms to the different treatment protocols at the LTER problematic.Our second hypothesis was that farmers manage all of their acreage using the same management regime or heuristic. Our results found this to not be so. The farmers managed their acreage using different heuristics for different fields at the same time. The heuristics included: 1) biophysical factors such as the differing slopes, soil textures and orientations of different fields; 2) organizational factors such as institutional pressures and rewards; 3) cultural factors such as personal beliefs and values; 4) population factors such as migration patterns and changes in population densities around the individual fields; and 5) technological factors such as the types of machinery, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides available for use, and the time, knowledge and economic resources necessary to utilize a technology.Our third hypothesis was that farmers manage a field following a consistent management scheme over time. Even this was shown not to be consistent. Individual fields were managed differently over time for a variety of reasons. These reasons were sorted into five categories. The first category is biophysical factors such as annual variation in the climate (temperature, precipitation), and the type and pressure of weeds the past season. The second category includes demographic changes such as aging, health, and family structural changes such as the birth or death of a family member or divorce. The third category, organizational changes, includes changes such as new markets, changes in land tenure, and/or incorporation of the farm operation. The fourth category, changing cultural pressures, includes educational changes. The last category, technological changes, includes changes in crop needs.On the basis of these results, we are gathering information that will allow us to further understand the factors that are influencing the operators' attitudes and behavior, and to build a model of the farm operators&#8217; decision-making process.Return to Contents"

  abstract: <font size="2">Accurate regional to global scale land cover classification is needed as input to many models concerning global change research. Current land cover characterizations are inconsistent in method and result. Remote sensing has long been championed to redress this problem. To overcome problems with optical remote sensing (e.g. atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations in illumination, sensor calibration), image data acquired by existing orbital radar systems (European ERS-1, C-band, vv-polarization; Japanese JERS-1, L-band, hh-polarization) are used to define a unique classifier. Unlike optical remote sensing techniques, radar remote sensing can provide calibrated data where the image signal is solely determined by the physical (structural) and electrical properties of the targets on the Earth's surface and near subsurface.</font><font size="2">To date we have classified radar image composites from test sites in different eco-zones throughout a network of LTER sites. We have found that similar structural types of vegetation from different test sites show similar (absolutely calibrated) backscatter values and are classified correctly by applying the same set of decision rules. Temporal variations of backscatter values, resulting in a constraint of the applicability of a single classifier. are found to be due to freeze/thaw conditions, defoliation or when intercepted rain covered the vegetation during data acquisition.</font>

  abstract: A series of relatively simple conceptual indices were designed for use in identification of patterns of agricultural enterprise, soil ecosystem and nematode community quality. The enterprise quality component takes into consideration system age, goal accomplishments and ecosystem structure. The soil quality analysis is based on system disturbance, nature of abiotic factors and extent of interdependence among biotic parameters. Patterns of nematode community ecology are evaluated through use of system disturbance, taxon composition and population density. The procedure will be tested using nematode and soil data from the Kellogg Biological Station, Long-Term Ecological Research Program and the Living Field Laboratory, and other nematode community ecology research sites throughout Michigan. It will also be used for education and discussion purposes. The evaluation criteria are based in-part from the works of Capra (1996) and Ferris, Bongers and de Goede (1999).

However, the physiological diversity of the soil microbiota is poorly understood, since most of its phylogenetic diversity is not well represented in culture, such as the <i>Acidobacteria</i> division.

  abstract: This project developed a methodology to monitor LTER treatments using automated acoustic recording instruments to determine if treatments have different &#8220;Acoustic Signatures&#8221;. We anticipated that each habitat would bear a unique set of acoustical characteristics&#8211; an &#8220;Acoustic Signature&#8221;. As a component of the study, we utilized acoustics to determine the presence of vocalizing species. Our initial focus was on birds, with ancillary information on the presence of amphibians and insects. Prior to this research, there had not been any surveys of birds or amphibians in the Kellogg LTER. We also anticipated that we could characterize the relative amount of biological activity (Biophony) in the treatments. We also measured temporal effects on species activity, and the automation of recording systems allowed us to evaluate the degree of human disturbance (Anthrophony). A long term goal of this research is to test the &#8220;Acoustic Niche Hypothesis&#8221; which states that organisms compete for acoustic spectral space.We have developed methods and instrumentation to automatically record acoustic signals in a selected set of LTER treatments to determine if they have a unique signature. We used the automated recording systems to determine the acoustic signatures in selected treatments, and then compared signatures among treatments. The automated recording instrumentation also captured the occurrence of vocalizing species in LTER treatments.&nbsp; We examined the importance of edge effects from nearby landscapes and how these habitats influence the soundscape within the research area. The recordings were used to classify sounds and to develop a measure of the degree of biological activity in the different treatments. We characterized the degree of biological activity over time to determine peak biological activity timings in LTER treatments.

  abstract: "<font size=\"2\">The Below Ground Productivity (BGP) study was initiated in 1995 to take advantage of 3 long term agricultural experiments at KBS: the LTER main site (LTER), the Agroecosystem Interaction Site (AIS), and the Living Field Laboratory (LFL). In 1995, these experiments offered otherwise similar treatments with contrasting histories with respect to the cultivation of C-3 and C-4 crop species. In treatment 6 at the LTER, alfalfa was being grown for the 7th consecutive year following a year in soybeans (all C-3), whereas at the AIS, alfalfa was planted following 9 years of continuous corn (C-3 on C-4), and at the LFL, corn was planted following at least 8 years in alfalfa, soybean and wheat (C-4 on C-3).</font><font size=\"2\">Our plan was to use the relative 13C enrichment of C-4 plants as a tracer to differentiate new production (associated with 1995 crop roots) from previous production, and to differentiate the signal produced by the past decade of management from the signal produced by all previous vegetation. We were particularly interested in the possibility using delta 13C analysis to differentiate between the root and microbial components of soil respiration.</font><font size=\"2\">To achieve these objectives, we recruited a multidisciplinary team of researchers to measure the total production of, and C isotope ratio in, roots, soil organic matter, soil microbes, and soil CO2. Root analyses included minirhizotron measurements throughout the 1995 season, and destructive samples for root length density and root mass taken at five dates from spring 1995 to spring 1996. Soil and microbial analyses were performed in conjunction with these destructive samples, and included total C, 320 day C mineralization kinetics, and microbial biomass using both chloroform fumigation and direct microscopy. Soil respiration measurements were planned at the soil surface and at depth throughout the season, although the depth samples proved unsuccessful.</font><font size=\"2\">Data analyzed in time for this report include root mass and delta 13C , microbial biomass C, and mineralization kinetics for the May 1995 soil sample. The delta 13C dynamics of the CO2 collected during the May 320 day incubation are presented graphically below with the delta 13C measurement of each soil provided as a reference.</font><font size=\"2\">All of the soils are enriched in 13C relative to C-3 plant residue, which indicates a previous history of C-4 vegetation, most likely from corn cultivation. The recent history of corn cultivation at AIS produced a strong C-4 signal throughout the incubation. Combining the delta 13C measurements for the last three sample periods (80-200d), 46% of the CO2 produced by the AIS soils can be attributed to corn production, compared to 31% for the LFL and 25% for the LTER sites.

  abstract: Contributions of a legume crop to the soil nitrogen dynamics were evaluated at the LTER root turnover site which compared soluble soil nitrogen pools among treatments of bare soil in the presence and absence of alfalfa roots and shoots in a Kalamazoo loam soil (mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Spring spray-killing of the alfalfa generated 310 kg N ha-1 in the 0-120 cm soil profile during the 8-month period from April 29 to December 17, 1997, Table 1. After three years without plant growth, mineralization of SOM in the bare soils produced 170 kg N ha-1 during the same 8-month period of time. Therefore, decomposition of a two-year alfalfa crop produced 140 kg N ha-1 during the subsequent 1997 growing season. The best cover crop management system for transferring this excessive soil nitrogen to subsequent cash crops is currently being studied in a rye-cover crop and Roundup-Ready corn management system.Table 1.

  abstract: <font size="2">Soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), and upland soils are important sinks of methane (CH4). Both CH4 and N2O are major greenhouse gases which continue to increase in concentration in the atmosphere. Studies have shown that nitrogen fertilization increases the soil N2O source strength and decreases the CH4 sink strength. Thus, increased N deposition may theoretically contribute to an atmospheric increase of both N2O and CH4. However, in most works high single doses of N have been applied to study the N effects on trace gas fluxes from soils. This study examines fluxes of CH4, N2O, and CO2 from plots in the KBS LTER deciduous forest sites, coniferous forest sites, and successional field sites where N is being applied to simulate enhanced atmospheric depositions. Amended plots receive 10 or 30 kg N ha-1 annually, equivalent to or three-fold higher than the annual N deposition in the study area. The nitrogen is added as NH4NO3 in 5 doses over the growing season, and gas fluxes recorded at bi-monthly to monthly intervals.</font><font size="2">The results from 1995, the first year of sampling, show that average N2O fluxes from coniferous sites increased up to 5-fold in response to the N fertilization (Table 1). However, the numbers are associated with large variability and are not statistically different. Nitrous oxide fluxes from the the deciduous forest and successional fields were not altered by the N fertilization. The increased N2O activity in the coniferous sites was usually observed within two weeks following the N application (<a href="Ambus%20Figure%201.htm">Fig. 1</a>). At this point it is not clear why the N2O fluxes from the coniferous sites and not the deciduous and successional sites responded to the N. The inorganic N pools averaged 6.0&plusmn;0.6 &micro;g N g-1 dry soil, 6.6&plusmn;0.8, and 4.5&plusmn;0.5 in the coniferous, deciduous and successional sites, respectively. The results show a potentail for substantial increases in N2O emissions due to anticipated increases in atmospheric N depositions.</font><font size="2">Net CH4 uptake occured in all sites (Table 2). The CH4 uptake rates were higher in the old-growth deciduous forest than in the recently disturbed conifer plantations and successional fields. This is in agreement with other works showing decreased CH4 uptake following soil disturbance, and that this depressed CH4 uptake may be mirrored decades after the land use has been reversed. Methane fluxes were not clearly affected by the fertilization, that is in some sites, <i>e.g.</i> 1 DF, the CH4 uptake tended to decrease whereas in other sites, <i>e.g.</i> 2 DF, the activity tended to increase. We found evidence that peak CH4 uptake activity is located at &gt; 5 cm depth (<a href="Ambus%20Figure%202.htm">Fig. 2</a>). Since the N was added in low doses of only 2-3 kg N ha-1 on the soil surface it is likely that most nitrogen was utilized by plants and microorganisms in the very top soil and never reached the deeper layers of peak methanotrophic activity. Whether this mechanism is in effect will be examined in controlled experiments in the laboratory and through continued fertilization and gas sampling in 1996. Continued fertilization may create more N saturated conditions in the top soil layers and cause not only higher emissions of N2O, but also affect CH4 uptake on the long term.</font><font size="2">Table 1.

  abstract: We studied the species assemblages of predatory coccinellids in response to changes in habitat maturation in alfalfa (perennial, periodical disturbances, stable structural vegetation), poplars (perennial, seldom disturbed, changing plant structure) and early successional (successional vegetation, non disturbed, changing plant structure).A monitoring network was established in the main site of the Long Term Ecological Research at the Kellogg Biological Station. During twelve summers (1989 to 2000), coccinellid adults were sampled weekly at each one of the poplar, alfalfa, and early successional plots.We observed a "succession" of dominant species within the coccinellid complex as poplars aged. The dominant beetle species in young poplar plantations (one to four years) were also dominant in the adjacent field crops. Thereafter, the dominant coccinellid species in poplar were species typical of deciduous habitats. In early successional we found that an optimal level of species diversity and abundance of coccinellids occurs during the second year of plant succession.

  abstract: "The ability to hear and to interpret sound is one of our basic senses. Sounds produced by the environment enable humans to assess the health of the ecosystems within which they live or extract resources. The arrays of sounds in a place depend on the habitat type, the mosaic of habitats in the landscape, the time of day, and the season of the year. We have hypothesized that sounds also reflect the status of the ecosystems. Many groups of animals produce sound and use acoustic signals to communicate. Patterns of acoustic signals reflect the dynamics of biological, social, and physical systems in the landscape. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of acoustic signal patterns reflect changes in those dynamics. The exact meaning of these signals, in terms of the processes and interactions they represent between social and bio-physical systems, is a challenging area of study.A framework for the study and understanding of patch-level acoustic signals from a landscape is presented. This framework includes a) the definition of a soundscape, b) a taxonomy of the biological and physical characteristics of a soundscape, c) an analytical approach to quantify the components of an acoustic sample taken from the environment, d) a protocol for measurement of acoustic signals in the environment, e) a cyber-infrastructure necessary to manage numerous acoustic signals sampled from different environments, and f) a web tool to present acoustic information in near-real time from different places at different times. We have developed methods to characterize acoustics in human dominated ecosystems.Our findings are in three areas: soundscape classification; measurement of diurnal patterns of acoustics, and the development of indices relating human and biophysical acoustics."

  abstract: "The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) is an invasive species from Asia that has become a major pest of soybean in the US since its discovery in 2000. Prior research has shown that existing natural enemy communities contribute to A. glycines population regulation in Michigan soybeans and can result in effective economic control. The differential disturbance gradients represented on the KBS LTER site are likely to influence A. glycines population regulation via two mechanisms. First, 14 years of differential management on the KBS LTER site have created differences in generalist natural enemy assemblages that may regulate the ability of this invasive herbivore to successfully colonize these habitats via top-down influences. Second, by altering soil and nutrient conditions, treatment regimes may alter host plant phenology and nutritional quality through bottom\x96up effects that may influence A. glycines intrinsic rate of increase. We present results from 2003 studies on the KBS LTER site that test three hypotheses: 1. Generalist predator communities do not differ among selected LTER treatments. 2. A. glycines establishment and population growth does not differ among the selected treatments. 3. There is no direct or interactive effect of predator community and agronomic practice on A. glycines population regulation in the selected treatments. These studies provide a view of the ecological factors regulating A. glycines populations under a variety of relevant agronomic conditions in Michigan and provide information on practical management options."

  abstract: Defoliation is predicted to lead to a strong increase in carbon allocation to leaf regrowth, at the expense of carbon allocation to root growth, root carbon stores, and perhaps nutrient acquisition. We tested this hypothesis in four replicate stands of hybrid poplars (Populus x euramericana cv Eugenii) on the Kellogg Biological Station LTER site, with a control and defoliated treatment in each block. We moved gypsy moth egg masses and insects off the control treatments and into the defoliated treatments, and achieved large differences between levels of defoliation in the two treatments in 1997. Early summer root production (May to July) and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) in fine roots sampled at peak leaf regrowth were strongly reduced in the defoliated treatment compared to the control treatment. These changes in root growth and root carbon stores are consistent with a shift in carbon allocation away from roots and towards leaf regrowth following defoliation.Return to Contents

  abstract: This research synthesizes patterns of response of eight species of Coccinellidae, generalist insect predators of plant inhabiting herbivores, to an array of management regimes in a variety of plant communities and cropping systems implemented at the KBS LTER. The work is based on a 14-year project aimed to examine ecological principles as substitutes for chemical subsidies in agricultural ecosystems. This project also relates to the LTER Network theme of trophic dynamics in space and time. Weekly species counts of adult beetles have been made from May through August at 210 permanent locations. The sample array covers all seven KBS LTER treatments, cropping rotations and plant communities. The resulting 444,000 observations of insect abundance have been stored in a relational &gt; &gt;database, and linked to 14 years of daily weather observations to provide a spatial-temporal landscape scale response to treatment and plant community regimes. In addition, a system has been developed to automate the production of distribution maps for 8 species of insect predators at intervals of 100, 200, 400 and 1200 degree days over the 14 year time span resulting in 2600 distribution maps. This spatial-temporal database is being analyzed to model the numerical response of these species to changing plant communities, cropping patterns, treatment manipulation and meteorological conditions. During the observation period we have quantified natural biological regulation of a plant herbivore, documented the outbreak of two exotic species, examined the interaction of exotic and native predators, quantified the response of species to changing plant growth and characterized long term population trends in predators.

Current systems are limited in that they can only perform object classification of up to 3 bacterial morphotypes: straight rods, spheres, and curved rods. Our goal is to develop user-friendly, interactive software that can extract the full information value present within digital images of microbial communities. Our system, called \"CMEIAS<sup>&atilde;</sup>\" (<u>C</u>enter for <u>M</u>icrobial <u>E</u>cology <u>I</u>mage <u>A</u>nalysis <u>S</u>ystem), consists of plug-ins for the free, open-architecture UTHSCSA ImageTool software operating on a personal computer in a Windows NT environment.

The second version of CMEIAS<sup>&atilde;</sup>currently under development has efficient semi-automated segmentation tools to reduce the image to objects of interest, various new measurement features to compute an unlimited degree of morphological diversity using the latest compilation of phylogenetically relevant information from Bergey&rsquo;s Manual as reference, microbial abundance (concentration, biovolume, biomass C, biosurface area, cumulative hyphal length), various plotless, plot-based and geo-referenced spatial distribution relationships of the microbes, color recognition capability to extract phylogenetic, metabolic, and strain-specific autecological information from microbial communities using fluorescent molecular probes, and various Photoshop action sequences / Excel macros to facilitate routine image processing and data management tasks prior to and after image analysis. The data acquired from CMEIAS<sup>&atilde;</sup>can be exported into EcoStat and GS+ Geostatistics software to compute numerous ecological indices that characterize the microbial community under investigation. Our vision of CMEIAS<sup>&atilde;</sup>is that it will become an accurate, robust, and user-friendly image analysis tool that can significantly enhance the ability to analyze whole community samples without cultivation, and provide wide application in studies of microbial ecology."

  abstract: "Weathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks. Chemical weathering involves the dissolution, alteration, and replacement of minerals unstable at the Earth&rsquo;s surface and/or precipitation of new minerals that are stable. The products of chemical weathering (e.g., soils and solutes) and processes (CO2 cycling) are important to the ecology of systems and to issues of global climate change. Although it is well known that the rates of chemical weathering are a function of the chemistry of the parent material, climate (temperature and precipitation), biological activity, and hydrology, there are still many questions as to how all of these factors interrelate to control weathering rates.The objective of this long-term research is to investigate the roles of hydrology, climate, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity on chemical weathering rates via intersite LTER comparisons. The research is directed toward answering two questions: 1) what drives chemical weathering and 2) what are the links of chemical weathering to the ecosystem? The objectives are to: 1) initiate intersite comparisons that eventually include all LTER sites with surface and groundwater chemical fluxes, 2) utilize hydrologic and chemical data to calculate weathering rates, 3) test paradigms of weathering controls (T, P, etc.), and 4) link weathering to feedback mechanisms and ecology.To facilitate this research, an LTER-sponsored workshop was recently held with representatives from Luquillo, Konza, KBS, McMurdo, and North Temperate Lakes LTER sites. A position paper was developed to be given to the LTER PIs along with a questionnaire about each LTER site. Results from the questionnaire will be used to complete a data matrix started at the workshop on characterizing all LTERs. The data completed matrix will summarize the data available from and data needs of the various LTERs. A proposal will be submitted to NCEAS for workshop(s) to bring researchers from LTERs together to discuss weathering issues. Weathering rates will be developed for those sites that have already collected necessary data.A proposal for intersite work will be generated from these activities. The proposed research would provide for analysis of additional chemical parameters, including SiO2, as needed to develop complete chemical profiles at each site. An important aspect of this research is that it will provide a template for LTERs to collect a coordinated set of biogeochemical measurements that can be used for future intersite LTER comparisons.Return to Contents"

  abstract: "<font size=\"2\">Ground beetle abundance was monitored in the KBS LTER during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. Four species numerically dominated the fauna and together accounted for 87% of the total specimens collected: <i>Cyclotrachelus sodalis</i> (LeConte), <i>Poecilus lucublandus</i> (Say), <i>Pterostichus melanarius</i> (Illiger), and <i>Agonum placidum</i> (Say). Overall ground beetle abundance was relatively similar across the four annual crop and two perennial crop habitats, but was considerably lower in the native succession habitat. Differences in representation of dominant species was most pronounced between perennial and annual crop systems. However, tillage also influenced the relative of abundance of these species. The adult-overwintering, spring-breeding species, P. lucublandus and A. placidum, were most common in the annual crop habitats, particularly those under conventional tillage. In contrast, C. sodalis, a larval-overwintering, autumn breeder, was most common in the perennial crop systems. The exotic species <i>P. melanarius</i> showed the least response to the agricultural habitat treatments but was more abundant in managed crop habitats compared to unmanaged habitats. Further research is needed: 1) to determine why ground beetle activity was so low in the native succession habitat; 2) to evaluate the relationship between ground beetle life cycle and agroecosystem management; and 3) to better understand the relationship between agricultural landscape diversity, ground beetle diversity, and pest suppression.</font>"

Concentric layers of soil aggregates were removed by the soil aggregate erosion (SAE) method and C sources identified by their <sup>13</sup>C signatures. Roots of contemporary plants contributed from 46 to 80% of the total C isolated from outer soil layers. Similar C gradients could not be detected within soil aggregates sampled from adjacent native forest ecosystems. Deposition of N to soil aggregate layers was evaluated by growing a rye cover crop whose shoots were labeled with 99 % atom excess <sup>15</sup>N as (<sup>15</sup>NH4)2SO4 and spray-killed two weeks following labeling. Three months after rye death, soil aggregates contained atom excesses of 0.014 and 0.035% <sup>15</sup>N deposited by decomposing rye roots or roots plus shoots. Total N in the exterior layers of aggregates was 1.6, 1.4, and 1.2 g N kg-1 in treatments containing in situ rye roots, rye shoots applied to the soil surface, and bare soils. Interior regions of all soil aggregates contained an average of 1.25 g N kg-1. Observed C and N gradients demonstrate the importance of measuring concentric layers when evaluating short-term changes in the C and N dynamics associated with soil aggregates.

  abstract: Microbial Community Structure Changes Following a Change in Vegetative CoverMicrobial diversity of soil is extremely high, and most of this diversity cannot be cultured. To compare soil samples for their microbial community composition total genomic DNA of bacteria can be studied. Since the base composition of DNA differs among bacterial genera a community profile based on the guanine and cytosine concentration (%G+C) in the extracted DNA from soil can be made. The resulting profile is based on the relative abundance of DNA of different G+C composition, and creates a fingerprint of the community composition (Holben and Harris, 1991). This is an approximation of the microbial diversity at the genus level.The complex mixture of bacterial genomes is qualitatively and quantitatively characteristic of the microbial community. Therefore, community shifts can be represented in the overall DNA based community profile. The range of bacterial %G+C is from 24% (Clostridum and Mycoplasma) to 76% (Oerskoviae). Phylogentically coherent species have not more than 3% difference, and the species of a genus are not expected to differ by more than 10% (Stackebrandt and W. Liesack, 1993).We studied the effect of a change in vegetative cover of a Hawaiian soil from forest to pasture. DNA was extracted from both soils and compared by the abundance of its guanine and cytosine (G+C) composition. A gradient of %G+C concentration was then established by equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation, and 0.2 ml fractions were collected by a fraction collector. The G+C profile of soil DNA was shifted to significantly higher G+C DNA with the change from forest to pasture (Fig. 1) which indicates significant changes in the composition of the soil bacterial community.The majority of soil DNA was in the 55% to 70% G+C range for both soils but the major peak was 61% G+C for the forest soil DNA and 67% G+C for the pasture soil. The pasture soil community exhibited an additional peak in the 42 to 45% G+C range, and displayed a small peak of 71% G+C. DNA extracted from replicate soil samples showed repeated profiles such that within site variation was much less than differences between the two sites (Fig. 1). The standard deviations of the mean curve differences for the forest and pasture soil communities were small, s = 0.14 and s = 0.27, respectively.Evidence from 3H-labeling experiments and G+C based fractionation of soil community DNA indicates that activity and growth are not confined to a small fraction of the bacterial biomass but are widespread amongst the genera represented in the profile (Harris, 1994).The G+C based fractionation of soil extracted DNA yielded community profiles specific for each soil site and of the entire soil microbial community that can be compared, and allows the selective analysis of soil community subsets. In addition to lowering diversity to a more manageable level, the G+C separation step is also a means to detect less dominant organisms in a community. The reliability of this technique could be shown through statistical comparisons of repetitive experiments. The G+C method provides an analysis at a coarser level of taxon distinction but is comprehensive for all DNA. This method becomes especially powerful when combined with other DNA based techniques such as 16S rRNA clone library analysis.Return to Contents

  abstract: <font size="2">Management of agroecosystems to enhance natural regulation of insect pests requires an understanding of predator ecology and how predatory insects use the landscape and respond to its structural characteristics. A group of predatory insects, ladybird beetles, were selected to study patterns of habitat utilization in response to vegetation type, management practices, and habitat succession in a complex agricultural landscape.</font><font size="2">The field work was conducted at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), in southwest Michigan. First, a life systems study of <i>Coleomegilla maculata lengi</i> was conducted by sampling wooded habitats to determine beetle aggregation sites in the landscape, and by using stable isotopes to determine paths of energy flow in the beetle-crop system. Secondly, abundance patterns of fourteen species of coccinellids were monitored weekly during the growing season using yellow-sticky traps. The sampled landscape consisted of an array of field crops under different management practices, interspersed with perennial biomass plantations and vegetation in a state of secondary succession. Seven years of weekly abundance records were analyzed using Shannon Wiener and richness indices, Kendall's coefficient of concordance, and principal component analysis. The results of the analysis were used to produce a spatially explicit population model for comparative analysis of landscape-predator interactions.</font><font size="2">The main findings of the study were:</font><font size="2">Within the framework of the KBS LTER theme that ecological knowledge can replace chemical subsidies, this work contributes to the role that management practices can have on beneficial insects and identifies landscape characteristics conducive to maintaining higher numbers of beneficial insect predators within agroecosystems.</font>

  abstract: Soil organic matter (SOM) functions as both a source and sink for atmospheric CO<sub>2.</sub> Concern over the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has focused research efforts on understanding the quality and quantity of C that can be stored in SOM and the degree to which this storage can be used to mitigate for industrial pollution. Sequestration of C and N in soils can be greatly improved by changes in current agricultural practices and understanding the quantity of C and N that can be stored under these changes is necessary for U.S. policy decisions. C and N sequestration was determined over ten years of management for seven different agricultural systems at the Kellogg Biological Station, MI. Soil organic matter dynamics were evaluated using long term incubations to determine pool sizes for C including the active C pool (Ca), slow C pool (Cs) and resistant pool (Cr). Changes in pool sizes and mean residence times (MRT) of the C pools is indicative of C sequestration potential for the site.

  abstract: <font size="2">Most studies on nitrogen loss from ecosystems measure only the inorganic forms of nitrogen, ignoring mobile organic forms such as amino acids, aminated sugars, and humic acids that dissolve into soil water and as such can be lost. Although long an important parameter in aquatic research, dissolved organic nitrogen(DON) in soil leachate has only been measured in a few forest studies. Some preliminary data from lysimeters in the LTER site, however, suggest that loss of nitrogen as DON can occasionally be as great as the amount lost as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.</font><font size="2">Over the past year we have taken samples of soil leachate with quartz (Teflon) suction lysimeters from all LTER treatments except the never tilled grassland (T8), including the forested sites. Lysimeters are placed in the C-horizon of each sample site, and thus provide an integrated estimate of solution N loss to groundwater. Quartz/PTFE(Teflon) lysimeters are used because they are less likely to filter out DON than ceramic cup lysimeters.</font><font size="2">Samples were analyzed for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and DON. Results discussed here are for samples taken between May and December 1995. Although absolute levels were rarely higher than 20 ppm for each form, the relative proportion of organic nitrogen to inorganic was often surprisingly high (50-100%). Differences in NO3<sup>-</sup> and DON between LTER treatments were inconclusive due to high variability. In general NO3<sup>-</sup> levels were higher under tilled, fertilized sites. The most unexpected result was the apparent correlation between NO3<sup>-</sup> and DON concentrations in samples with greater than 1 ppm DON (<a href="Boles%20Figure%201.htm">Figure 1</a>). In Figure 1 note that there is no relation between DON and NO3<sup>-</sup> for all samples under 1 ppm DON. Above 1 ppm DON, however, there is always an almost equal amount of NO3. Separately, the samples with greater than 1 ppm DON showed a strong correlation with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.84; <a href="Boles%20figure%202.htm">Figure 2</a>). This has implications for interpreting nitrogen budget deficits, long assumed to be due to denitrification, as well as for our general understanding of hydrologic N losses from upland ecosystems.</font>

  abstract: We are trying to develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between N<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub> flux from agricultural and forest soils. Both gases are products of denitrification but N<sub>2</sub>O is also a product of nitrification and perhaps other processes. Our approach is to apply <sup>15</sup>N-labeled material to soil, and then monitor production (or consumption) of N<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O in a soil cover headspace. N<sub>2</sub>O may be determined by gas chromatography (GC) or by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). N<sub>2</sub>, however, may only be determined by mass spectrometry under these conditions. If only denitrifiers contribute to N-gas production, and if consumption of N-gas in soil is negligible, then the results of the two methods for N<sub>2</sub>O analysis should agree.Data collected over the last 16 months from agricultural soil (corn stubble, LTER bulk plots) and forest soil (deciduous, Long Woods) indicate that for N<sub>2</sub>O, fluxes measured by GC and IRMS rarely agree. Usually IRMS values are much lower than GC values, which strongly suggests (for mathematical reasons) that flux derives from a non-uniformly labeled pool of soil mineral N. Sometimes GC values are lower than IRMS values, suggesting that significant consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O is co-occurring with N<sub>2</sub>O production during the incubation.In April 1999, fertilizer solution or water (control) was added to 16 plots (4 treatments x 4 replicates) in Long Woods. In the main treatment, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrate (99%) was added at a rate of 45 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> while unlabeled ammonium was added at a rate of 70 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup>. In one variant of the main treatment, ammonium was labeled (99%) and nitrate was unlabeled. In another variant, labeled nitrate was applied at a lower rate (4.5 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup>) but at the same enrichment. Incubations were conducted immediately after (~ 2 h) and 14 d after additions. Samples were analyzed by GC and by IRMS.<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_1.htm">Figure 1</a> shows apparent enrichment of the soil mineral N pool for each incubation, inferred from the distribution of masses of N<sub>2</sub>O in the sampled headspace. In most cases, IRMS flux values were less than GC flux values (<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_2_.htm">Figure 2</a>) indicating that the apparent enrichments are overestimates, perhaps representing only the labeled portion of a two-pool system. Still, it appears that N<sub>2</sub>O from labeled ammonium is present as early as two hours after addition, suggesting tightly coupled nitrification and denitrification in this soil. Enrichment of the soil N pool in labeled-nitrate plots was initially similar to added nitrate, but dropped rapidly over a two-week interval, probably due to dilution by nitrification. In contrast, enrichment of N<sub>2</sub>O in labeled-ammonium plots rose with time. Probably most of this N<sub>2</sub>O was produced by denitrification of soil nitrate which was continually being enriched by nitrification of the ammonium pool. Not surprisingly, enrichment dropped more rapidly for plots with low rates of labeled nitrate application than for plots with high rates of labeled nitrate application. The overestimation represented by flux ratios greater than 1 (<a href="Figures/bergsma_figure_2_.htm">Figure 2</a>) may be an artifact of reduced analytical sensitivity due to very low enrichment in these plots.

  abstract: "The SALUS model is designed to simulate agroecosystem dynamics, including plant growth and development, soil water and heat flux and soil organic matter and nutrient fluxes, over short (growing season) to medium (several decades) time horizons. Its development was prompted by the need for an improved analysis of ecosystem responses to management and climate perturbations in complex cropping systems, including the opportunity to simulate many \"non-conventional\" management regimes. A major objectives has been to combine the attributes of daily-based functional crop growth models (e.g. CERES) with those of detailed biogeochemical models (e.g. Century) in order to represent both fine-scale, within season variability in plant, water and nutrient dynamics as well as longer-term feedbacks between management, soil characteristics and productivity. The project is a collaboration between investigators at Michigan State University (MSU) and Colorado State University (CSU).The model was written in Fortran-90, which affords a number of technical advantages including better &lsquo;encapsulation&rsquo; of program components, availability of complex data structures and explicit pointers and dynamic memory allocation. These attributes facilitate a more modular design compared to Fortran-77 based models and dynamic memory allocation allows several cropping systems to be run simultaneously, for example, spatially distributed applications linked through GIS.Major enhancement over antecedent models (CERES, Century) include multi-year simulations of crop growth using generic structures parameterized for specific species and varieties, a &lsquo;full&rsquo; plant C balance including root turnover, exudation and respiration, simulation of soil organic matter and nutrient turnover through the entire profile, &lsquo;time-to-ponding&rsquo; concepts to represent effects of within day variability of precipitation intensity effects on runoff and water balance, and an enhanced set of management options. A prototype graphical program has been developed to manipulate and plot model output.The model is currently running on UNIX, PC and Mac platforms. Model testing is underway, utilizing a variety of data from the KBS-LTER and other data from KBS experiments. We plan to complete this first comprehensive testing of the model in 1998, to be followed by submission of a paper describing and documenting the model, and additional collaborative papers using the model for interpretation and analysis of data from the LTER and other KBS experiments. Following completion of these analysis, we will conduct a cross-site application of the model for a set of long-term agricultural field experiments across the US to investigate interactions between management, crop growth and soil organic matter dynamics. Future objectives on which limited work has begun include incorporation of phosphorus dynamics and development of a user-friendly graphical user interface.SALUS Modeling Group: Brian Baer (MSU), Rodolfo Delgado (CSU), Aris Gerakis (MSU), Kendrick Killian (CSU), Keith Paustian (CSU), Joe Ritchie (MSU), Urs Schultress (MSU)Return to Contents"

  abstract: "Modeling SOM Dynamics and Management: Decision Making in an Enriched CO2 EnvironmentAs part of an &lsquo;LTER spinoff&rsquo; project, funded by DOE, we are conducting field and modeling work to support improved quantification of soil C changes in ecosystems influenced by present and/or past agricultural practices. The focus of the project is: a) to collect and analyze soil C from forest successional systems on abandoned agricultural soils, using adjacent never-tilled forest sites and permanent agricultural sites as references, together with SOM fractionation, natural abundance 13C and 14C dating, and b) to develop key databases for regional extrapolation of soil C dynamics and to improve models of SOM response to management and vegetational changes, using fractionation and isotopic studies from the field sites and from previously investigated agricultural sites. Objectives, progress and outlook are presented for the second objective only.We are estimating historical productivity data for ca. 20 long-term agricultural field sites in the central US by augmenting site records with county-average crop yields obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, US Agricultural Census and state-level records. Data obtained to date go back as far as 1917, but in most cases digital data are available from state sources only from about 1940 and nationally (NASS) since 1971. Data not available in digital form are being collected from printed reports. Initially we are focussing on counties corresponding to the long-term experiments, for which we will compare county-average and experiment station yields to develop correlations and derive &lsquo;best estimates&rsquo;of long-term trends for the pre-experimental period at each site. To estimate annual C inputs to soil, an extensive analysis of literature data has been used to derive a set of crop specific (which are time dependent to account for genetic improvements) functions relating grain yield to above-ground residue and root production. The yield data and C partitioning functions will first be used to estimate time series of historical C inputs for modeling SOM dynamics at the field sites (see below). Subsequently we will use the NASS yield data (1971-present) and the partitioning functions to estimate the quantify and trends of C inputs, nationally, as part of a larger effort to estimate the C balance for US agricultural soils.The objectives for site specific modeling of SOM dynamics is to evaluate to what extent measured &lsquo;pools&rsquo; of SOM, i.e. from aerobic incubation, acid hydrolysis and 14C dating, can be closely approximated by conceptual model pools and how general this correspondence is across differing climates, soil types and management regimes. A modeling framework, TRACE_C, has been developed to test alternative model structures and assumptions and to simulate C isotope dynamics in addition to total C and SOM pools dynamics. The model uses measured/estimated C inputs (see above) and climate data as the primary driving variables. Results so far from several sites show relatively good correspondence between measured and modeled total organic C and 13C signatures for the total soil, in both native and cultivated sites, using the default model structure. Model estimates of quantity and 13C for a &lsquo;resistant&rsquo; C were much less consistent with the attributes of the non-acid hydrolyzable fractions.Future work will focus on application of the model across all sites using the composite estimates of historical C inputs, evaluation of alternative model &lsquo;hypotheses&rsquo; (i.e. formulations )-- with comparisons of total C, analytical &lsquo;pools&rsquo;,and total soil 13C, C mineralization rates and 13CO2 signatures from long-term aerobic incubations -- and testing/adaptation of the model for forest and reforested soils investigated within the project.Return to Contents"

  abstract: Wetlands are often situated at points of groundwater recharge and discharge and hence biogeochemical processes in wetlands can affect downstream water quality. A survey was conducted along a hydrological gradient from groundwater-fed to precipitation-fed wetlands to determine the influence of hydrology on biogeochemical functions associated with anaerobic microbial processes. The 13 wetland study sites are located on glaciated terrain in southwestern Michigan. Nitrate concentrations were low or undetectable at all sites, even though groundwater inputs are often elevated in nitrate. Iron (II) was present in most wetlands, but varied among the sites. Sulfate reduction was greater in groundwater-fed wetlands than precipitation-fed wetlands, resulting in removal of sulfate and some accumulation of hydrogen sulfide. Sediment gas bubble samples usually contained at least 50% methane, indicating that methanogenesis is important in all types of wetlands. Considering the equivalent carbon mineralization rates, sulfate reduction is relatively important in the groundwater-fed wetlands, while methanogenesis is important at all sites and dominates in the precipitation-fed wetlands.

  abstract: We are using automated static chambers for frequent measurements of N2O emissions from soils under four different agricultural management systems (conventional, no-till, and organic soybean-wheat-corn rotations and continuous alfalfa). N2O emissions are sampled four times per day, and simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and temperature provide ancillary emission data as do periodic soil nitrate measurements. Fluxes vary smoothly over the time period thus far measured, suggesting that we are capturing most of the temporal variability present in the systems. N2O emissions often vary more than three-fold over a single day. Longer term trends appear related to soil moisture, temperature, and nitrogen availability. Maxium fluxes were nearly ten times higher in the conventional treatment than in the other treatments. Data will be used to test current models of N2O emission including DAYCENT.

  abstract: There is only limited information on how interaction between agronomic management and topography influences yield variability. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of management practices on relationship between grain yields and field topography in corn-soybean-wheat rotation system. We used crop yield and topographic data collected from a one-factor randomized complete block design (RCBD) experiment with 6 replications at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in southwest Michigan. The strength and directions of the relationships between topographical features and crop yields varied among treatments and crops. Relative elevation was the topographical characteristic that significantly interacted with management practice in affecting crop yields. In particular, the differences in crop yields between managements with no or low chemical inputs and managements with regular chemical inputs were greater in areas with lower elevation than in areas with medium elevation. The possible reason is that nutrient supply from organic-based input favors depression area. Nutrients distribution is not heavily affected in conventional input system.

  abstract: Humans are altering biodiversity and species distributions around the world, but the ecological implications of these changes are poorly understood. A mechanistic understanding of how plant species impact soil processes is needed to improve our ability to predict how future species shifts may affect ecosystem function. Agriculture in southwestern Michigan has reduced soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels dramatically and, following abandonment, old-fields that were once dominated by C<sub>4</sub> grasses typically contain mainly non-native C<sub>3</sub> species. We examined whether the reintroduction of C<sub>4</sub> grasses into old-fields has altered soil C and N cycling, over what timescale these impacts are measurable, and whether specific plant traits can predict those impacts. C<sub>4</sub> species typically have higher biomass and more recalcitrant tissue than C<sub>3</sub> grasses, and these differences in litter quality and quantity may affect C and N cycling. To examine decadal scale impacts, we measured plant and soil properties under monocultures of a C<sub>4</sub> species (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i>) established in 1994 in two old-fields and compared this to samples from adjacent C<sub>3</sub> grass-dominated plots. Andropogon had greater biomass and more recalcitrant tissue than the C<sub>3</sub> grass plots, and soils under Andropogon had significantly less inorganic N than under the C<sub>3</sub> species. We are using stable isotope analysis to determine if species differences are affecting total, labile and recalcitrant soil C pools. We are also investigating if these differences are related to species&#8217; N uptake/utilization or plant-soil feedbacks mediated through the microbial community. These preliminary findings have implications for our ability to predict how species invasions, extinctions, or shifts in relative abundance may alter soil processes.

  abstract: One of the most important proximal controls on N2O production in soils is N availability. In studies conducted at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in southwest Michigan in 2001 and 2002, we determined that N2O fluxes measured across a high resolution N gradient were moderately low (< 50 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) up to 101 kg N ha-1 additions where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes increased sharply. Two mechanisms that might explain the nonlinear response in N2O production to incremental N addition are differential uptake of N by the crop and changes in microbial processes responsible for N2O production across the N gradient. In 2003, N, as granular urea, was applied at nine levels from 0-292 kg N ha-1 yr-1 to 4 replicate fields in continuous corn and then incorporated. Plots were irrigated to alleviate water stress in the corn crop. We measured surface N2O fluxes after fertilization in plots where the corn was removed and in plots where the crop was left intact. Nitrification and denitrification assays were conducted to determine the relative importance of each of these processes in N2O production across the N gradient. Corn yields were determined at harvest and soil mineral N was determined at each flux measurement. The N2O flux response to the fertilizer gradient was linear in plots without corn and was nonlinear in plots with the crop.

Kellogg Biological Station in southwest Michigan we determined that N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes measured across a high-resolution N gradient were moderately low (&lt; 50 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) up to 101 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> additions (grain yield maximum), after which fluxes increased sharply. In 2003, N, as granular urea, was applied at nine levels from 0-292 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> to 8 replicate fields in continuous corn and then incorporated. Four replicates were irrigated to alleviate water stress in the corn crop. From these results we calculated the N rate at which we gained the greatest mitigation potential for the global warming impact (GWI) of these cropping systems by including contributions from all sources of radiative forcing in these systems &#8211; fertilizer, fuel, lime, pesticides, soil C change, and trace gas fluxes. We found that by fertilizing at the N level required to obtain maximum yield, we gained a 34% reduction in GWI compared to the N level that is considered best management practice. When crops were grown in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation, there was an additional 66% reduction in GWI. The GWI increases precipitously at N rates that are higher than those required to maintain yields, primarily driven by N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from the farm field and CO<sub>2</sub> produced during N fertilizer manufacture. By using less N fertilizer and maintaining fields in rotation, growers can significantly reduce the GWI of farming operations.

  abstract: Soil nutrients, microorganisms, and plant roots are non-uniformly distributed in most ecosystems. The rhizosphere, soil in direct contact with plant roots, sponsors a wider variety of microorganisms and higher rates of nutrient cycling than does the bulk soil. Understanding the spatial distribution of plant roots and soil nutrients is thus important for developing mechanistic interpretations of soil process rates. Plant roots are known to selectively proliferate into patches of high resource availability; however, less is known of plant root avoidance of low resource patches. Hence a selectively distributed rhizosphere may exert greater influence on soil processes in resource rich patches than in resource poor patches. We conducted two experiments examining root growth selectivity in response to the relative quality of resource patches. In the greenhouse, we planted <i>Avena sativa</i> into sand with a choice of two types of resource patches located in paired-opposite quarters of a 3L container. Four types of resource patches were paired for a total of six treatment combinations. The resource patches varied in N mineralization rate with patches of <i>Trifolium pratense</i> shoots mineralizing rapidly, <i>T. pratense</i> roots and green <i>A. sativa</i> leaves mineralizing at intermediate rates, and senesced A. sativa shoots mineralizing least. Twenty-eight days after seedlings were transplanted into containers the root length distribution varied with patch quality contrast. The highest patch quality contrast (<i>T. pratense</i> shoots versus senesced <i>A. sativa</i> shoots) resulted in 89% of total root length found in the high quality patches. Minimal contrast between patch qualities resulted in uniform root distribution. In an N fertilizer gradient experiment conducted on the KBS-LTER site, we compared <i>Zea mays</i> root proliferation in soil amended with <i>T. pratense</i> shoots against the background N fertilizer gradient. Root proliferation into the amended patch was 4 times greater than into unamended soil when no N fertilizer was applied, whereas at high N application rates root growth was similar in the amended and unamended soil. Root proliferation and aboveground biomass responded similarly to the N fertilizer gradient in that both plant responses were no longer sensitive to N availability at the same application level. We conclude that the potential for rhizosphere influences on patchy soil processes varies with contrast between patch qualities and overall nutrient availability.

  abstract: Growing concern over the potential loss of native biodiversity due to invasion by non-native species has resulted in a need for ecologists to better understand the relationship between community diversity and invasibility.&nbsp; A number of studies have investigated the relationship between species richness and invasibility at single points in time, but very few have examined the role of evenness, or the dynamics of these relationships across time.&nbsp; Kellogg Biological Station LTER provides a good system for quantifying such relationships, as species richness and abundance have been monitored over the past 14 years in old fields of varying ages.&nbsp; In this study, we examined relationships between community invasibility (changes in total and non-native species richness over time), invader impact (relative abundance of non-native species), species richness, biomass, and community evenness in successional communities at KBS.&nbsp; In early successional fields, total species richness has been increasing and evenness has been decreasing since the fields were last plowed in 1988, though the rates of invasion slowed after the first five years. Communities with high initial evenness had fewer non-native invasions and the higher native species richness over time, though evenness was not generally a good predictor of invasibility.&nbsp; In the three older successional fields, non-native abundance decreased while native species richness increased over ten years of monitoring. Evenness did not significantly change across the ten years.&nbsp; These patterns are in contrast to earlier studies that predicted that total species richness and evenness should increase with successional time, and that species richness, evenness, and invasibility are related in predictable ways. The identity and abundance of the dominant non-native species in this system, as well as past land use history, may explain some of the differences in relative invasibility and successional trajectories of these communities.

Traditional stable isotope approaches have not been successful. In this study, we introduce a new isotopic approach for determining the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification in nitrous oxide flux by measuring the <sup>15</sup>N content in each of the individual atoms in nitrous oxide. The difference ind<sup>15</sup>N between these atoms is termed Site Preference (S.P.) and is a promising approach for resolving the origins of nitrous oxide.

  abstract: Humans are altering biodiversity and species distributions around the world, but the ecological implications of these changes are poorly understood. A mechanistic understanding of how plant species impact soil processes is needed to improve our ability to predict how future shifts in species composition and abundance may affect ecosystem function. Agriculture in southwestern Michigan has reduced soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels dramatically and, following abandonment, old-fields that were once dominated by C4 grasses typically contain mainly non-native C3 species. We examined whether the reintroduction of C4 grasses into old-fields has altered soil C and N cycling, over what timescale these impacts are measurable, and whether specific plant traits can predict those impacts. C4 species typically have higher biomass and more recalcitrant tissue (both above- and below-ground) than C3 grasses, and these differences in litter quality and quantity are expected to affect C and N cycling. To examine species&#8217; decadal scale impacts, we measured plant and soil properties under monocultures of a C4 species (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i>) established in 1994 in two old-fields and compared this to samples from adjacent C3 grass-dominated plots. <i>Andropogon</i> had greater aboveground biomass (6-10 times), belowground biomass (1.3-2 times), and tissue C:N (2 times) than the C3 dominated plots. Soils under <i>Andropogon</i> had significantly less inorganic N than under the C3 species (5.46 &#61617; 0.66 vs. 6.97 &#61617; 0.39 mg N/g soil). There were also some subtle differences in soil total C, and we are exploring this in greater detail using stable isotope analysis to determine if species differences are affecting total, labile and recalcitrant soil C pools. We are also investigating if these soil differences are related to species&#8217; N uptake/utilization or plant-soil feedbacks mediated through the microbial community. These preliminary findings have implications for our ability to predict how species invasions, extinctions, or shifts in relative abundance may alter soil processes, as well as how C4 grass reintroduction may be used to restore these processes.

  abstract: "A major challenge in microbial ecology is to develop reliable methods of computer-assisted microscopy that can analyze digital images of complex microbial communities at single cell resolution, and compute useful ecological characteristics of their organization and structure <i>in situ</i> without cultivation. We are addressing this challenge by developing a new generation of interactive software that can extract the full information content in digital images of actively growing microbial communities. Our system, called CMEIAS (<b><u>C</u></b>enter for <b><u>M</u></b>icrobial <b><u>E</u></b>cology <b><u>I</u></b>mage <b><u>A</u></b>nalysis <b><u>S</u></b>ystem) consists of plug-ins for free ImageTool software running in Win NT4.0, a stand-alone color recognition program, and various Excel macros for data management and analysis. CMEIAS v1.27 can automatically classify bacterial morphotypes at 0.1% frequency with 97% accuracy. A website for CMEIAS is under construction for free release of v1.27 program files along with an operator manual. An upgraded CMEIAS v3.0 is being developed to extract 5 ecologically relevant parameters of microbial communities <i>in situ</i> in digital images: (i) classify their morphological diversity at a complexity level equivalent to 98% of the genera described in Bergey&#8217;s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, (ii) measure the abundance for both filamentous and non-filamentous microbes based on their cell density, biovolume and biomass carbon, (iii) detect their metabolic activity based on image color recognition, (iv) analyze their autecology and phylogeny based on image color recognition using molecular probes, and (v) analyze their spatial patterns of colonization and dispersion at single-cell resolution. CMEIAS data can also be exported into EcoStat and GS+ Geostatistics to compute numerous other indices and spatial autocorrelation models that further characterize microbial community structure. Here we report on four new developments for CMEIAS v3.0. First, we have introduced an <b>Object Separation</b> tool that automatically splits touching cells for object analysis and operates with an overall performance accuracy of 95.8%. Second, we have developed a <b>Color Recognition</b> program that segments foreground bacterial objects of interest in RGB color images. This program uses interactive sampling of up to 200 color pixels of the foreground microbes of interest, then applies a region-growing algorithm to find their cell boundary, and finally creates a new RGB image with these colored foreground microbes against a noise-free background. This new program will likely revolutionize the quantitative image analysis of bacteria differentiated by color in RGB images. Third, we introduce a <b>Sampling Statistics</b> macro that analyzes the appropriate sample size for community morphotype analysis by computing the tolerance envelope surrounding the existing data of morphotype diversity at a user-defined percentage confidence level. Fourth, we have evaluated 15 different formulas to compute <b>microbial biovolumes</b> from 2-dimensional projected images, and have identified / implemented the 8 most accurate formulas for all morphotypes recognized by CMEIAS. Our vision is for CMEIAS to become an accurate, robust and user-friendly software tool that can significantly enhance the analysis of whole community samples without cultivation, thereby creating many new applications for quantitative studies of <i>in situ</i> microbial ecology that were very difficult or almost impossible to do before (<i>e.g</i>., at spatial scales relevant to microbe-microbe interactions)."

  abstract: This research synthesizes patterns of response of eight species of Coccinellidae, generalist insect predators of plant inhabiting herbivores, to an array of management regimes in a variety of plant communities and cropping systems implemented at the KBS LTER. The work is based on a 14-year project aimed to examine ecological principles as substitutes for chemical subsidies in agricultural ecosystems. This project also relates to the LTER Network theme of trophic dynamics in space and time. Weekly species counts of adult beetles have been made from May through August at 210 permanent locations. The sample array covers all seven KBS LTER treatments, cropping rotations and plant communities. The resulting 444,000 observations of insect abundance have been stored in a relational database, and linked to 14 years of daily weather observations to provide a spatial-temporal landscape scale response to treatment and plant community regimes. In addition, a system has been developed to automate the production of distribution maps for 8 species of insect predators at intervals of 100, 200, 400 and 1200 degree days over the 14 year time span resulting in 2600 distribution maps. This spatial-temporal database is being analyzed to model the numerical response of these species to changing plant communities, cropping patterns, treatment manipulation and meteorological conditions. During the observation period we have quantified natural biological regulation of a plant herbivore, documented the outbreak of two exotic species, examined the interaction of exotic and native predators, quantified the response of species to changing plant growth and characterized long term population trends in predators.

N2O emissions are sampled four times per day, and simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and temperature provide ancillary emission data as do periodic soil nitrate measurements. Fluxes vary smoothly over the time period thus far measured, suggesting that we are capturing most of the temporal variability present in the systems. N2O emissions often vary more than three-fold over a single day. Longer term trends appear related to soil moisture, temperature, and nitrogen availability.

Aggregate stability decreased significantly following 2 DW cycles when C was not added. Additions of glucose-13C with each DW cycle maintained soil aggregate stability throughout the 35-day incubation and increased C flux into aggregate interiors. Spatial gradients in glucose-derived C within aggregates developed by repeated glucose additions with DW cycles controlled spatial distributions of microbial communities within aggregates. Rapid reductions in mineralization rates of glucose C indicated either physical protection or chemical stabilization of new C within aggregates. Constant supplies of glucose C at aggregate surfaces established C concentration gradients that promote C flux into microfissures of interior regions within stable aggregates during repeated DW cycles. These results identify additional C-enhancing mechanisms which increase soil sequestration of C generated by decomposing plant residues of no tillage agriculture."

  abstract: Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) production from terrestrial ecosystems has gained considerable attention due to an increase in the atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas and its ability to catalyze stratospheric ozone degradation. Since it is an intermediate of nitrite and nitrate reduction (denitrification) as well as a by-product of the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite (nitrification), it is feasible to identify the sources of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes by taking advantage of the differences in these two microbial processes. By examining the intramolecular distribution (isotopomers) of 15N in N<sub>2</sub>O produced from bacteria cultures, we have previously demonstrated that N<sub>2</sub>O from nitrification yields a site preference (difference between the central and terminal N atom in N<sub>2</sub>O) of 33 &#8240; compared to 0 &#8240; from denitrification. These results progressed to a field study from 2004 to 2006 at the Kellogg Biological Station LTER measuring soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and isotopomers in treatment plots managed with conventional agriculture and successional (tilled and untilled) techniques. Nitrous oxide was collected from soil chambers placed 5 cm deep and covered with a lid. The chambers were vented to the atmosphere by a 0.5 m length of stainless steel tubing. Gas samples were collected in pre-evacuated 250 mL glass bottles with butyl rubber septum through peek tubing fitted with a syringe needle. Given our estimates from 2004 and 2005 of microbial processes using site preference, N<sub>2</sub>O was predominantly from denitrification following initial cultivation of soils. In 2006, we measured N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and isotopomers in tilled and untilled mid-successional plots, a conventional agriculture field further treated with liquid manure and compared mid-successional to conventional agriculture treatments. In mid-May, site preference for soil-derived N<sub>2</sub>O was insignificant between the untilled mid-successional (11.9 to 16.1 &#8240;) and conventional agriculture (10.1 to 17.6 &#8240;) treatments, while soil treated with liquid manure exhibited a predominance of denitrification (1.8 to 2.8 &#8240;). Nitrous oxide measurements in early-June were constrained by low rainfall, with N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from conventional agriculture treatment plots exceeding fluxes from tilled and untilled mid-successional plots. Site preference for soil-derived N<sub>2</sub>O was between 19.0 and 21.8 &#8240; from the conventional agriculture treatment plots.

  abstract: Simulation of physical and biological phenomena at multiple time and space scales is playing a pivotal role in areas that range from genetic studies to global change analysis and assessment. Regional simulation models require the use of large data inputs and are evolving in scope and sophistication. A Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework (MASIF) is presented as a method to facilitate utilization of large amounts of spatial-temporal outputs from regional scale simulations. MASIF incorporates commercial software that provide the model analyst with the ability to rapidly summarize and analyze model results. MASIF enables visualization of model input data, model simulation results, and computation of statistical patterns of information associated with model inputs and outputs. In developing MASIF we have adopted a modular approach that allows the coupling of a model to the analysis and mapping framework using either executable model code or raw computer instructions, and the parameters files. We are currently enabling MASIF to accommodate satellite remotely sensing data as a driver to calibrate model predictions during simulation. For example, we use remote sensing information to adjust simulated biomass or LAI output from daily crop growth. &nbsp;The MASIF environment provides a powerful and flexible environment that allows model analysts to conduct creative regional experiments with either complex or simple regional models. By providing models with a robust user interface, modelers can optimize their efforts and concentrate on model development. We recognize the value of stand-alone and network-based analytical environments for model assessment and application and thus envision the potential to run, analyze, and visualize web-based simulation models.

  abstract: With the growing awareness of the environmental impact of humans, land managers are increasingly trying to reduce degradation while maintaining profitability. We tested the impact of management intensity on the level of nitrogen loss through nitrate leaching, greenhouse gas production, and carbon sequestration. Gas, soil water, and soil from four annual cropping systems (corn-soybean-wheat rotations managed as conventional, no-till, low-input, and organic systems), two perennial cropping systems (alfalfa and poplar trees), two successional systems (early and mid-successional old fields), and two forest systems (planted conifer and native deciduous systems) all replicated on the same soil series. Quartz soil water samplers were used to sample leachate, and samples were collected twice a month from March 1995-November 2005, and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen. Nitrate leaching was highest in annual agricultural plots and perennial alfalfa plots. Successional plots and plots with trees (fast growing poplar clones) showed the lowest leaching levels, while native forested sites showed intermediate levels of nitrate loss. Within agricultural systems, conventional tilled and no-tilled systems showed higher leaching losses than organic systems. Carbon sequestration was estimated based on comparisons of initial soil C levels and soil C levels after ten years. Carbon sequestration was highest in successional and perennial systems, although the no-till system also had a high rate of carbon sequestration. Greenhouse gas production was measured using the static chamber method, with samples being taken weekly to monthly from March-December. Greenhouse gas production was similar across all the annual cropping systems and alfalfa, while native systems were consistently lower in greenhouse gas emissions. Results suggest ecosystem service trade-offs in these systems, and that managers will need to make prioritized management choices. Results also show how land use changes alter the partitioning of ecosystem services across the landscape.

  abstract: Insect herbivory may regulate forest productivity through its effects on nutrient cycling. Extensive defoliation of trees represents a severe perturbation to the N cycle of an ecosystem. Defoliation results in a rapid and substantial transfer of foliar N to the forest floor, primarily as frass, and the trees are denied the opportunity to internally recycle foliar N prior to senescence. What is the fate of this N? Will it be conserved in the soils organic matter via the soils microbial biomass? Or will it be lost to the atmosphere through NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization and/or denitrification, or to the ground water as soluble N? Or does its fate depend more on the synchronization between frass deposition and rainfall and temperature patterns?</font><font size="2">The defoliation residue (ie frass, leaf debris, and insect cadavers) is of high quality (ie low C:N ratio) and in the case of poplars low in lignin:N. We will measure the rate of formation, quality and fate of this residue in the field. This residue is analogous to animal manure, for which it is known that most of the N mineralized is lost to the atmosphere as NH3 if the manure remains on the soil surface for more than a few days. Our hypothesis is that gypsy moth defoliation will cause an immediate and substantial loss of N from a Poplar stand. This loss will result in long-term N shortages exacerbated by changes in litter-fall chemistry and soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. Much of the N loss will occur as NH3 volatilized from frass, the other portion will come from hydrological loss of SOM-derived N and decomposed poplar root-N. Hydrological losses will occur subsequent to defoliation when plant transpiration is low and warmer and wetter soils accelerate N mineralization and profile water movement. Any microbial immobilization of frass-N, SOM-derived N and Poplar root-N will lead to SOM formation and later release of this N on only a long-term basis.

  abstract: A research objective at the KBS-LTER is to examine how research on row crop agroecosystems at KBS represents crop production in the US Corn Belt. To facilitate this objective we developed a Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework (MASIF) which links an array of existing visualization, analytical, and data management software to manage model inputs and outputs as well as model execution. We are conducting three projects that demonstrate applications of MASIF. In the first project we want to characterize and analyze crop productivity in the North Central Region and explore future scenarios via modeling. We have conducted an analysis and comparison of historical observational data with outputs from crop simulation models. In the second project a crop model was calibrated to the cooler climate of the Upper Great Lakes Region. We tested the effects of temperature modifications and related that to the performance of the model. In the third project we have incorporated the DAYCENT model with MASIF to simulate regional sinks and sources of greenhouse gasses from agricultural soils including croplands and grasslands. We anticipate that simulations will provide information to decision makers for the assessment of economic, environmental and biophysical impacts of mitigation practices and policies.

  abstract: Microbial nitrogen transformations in soil represent the most significant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), yet annual flux estimates are fraught with uncertainty due to limited measurements and high spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, the unknown contribution of specific microbial N<sub>2</sub>O production pathways to total flux limits our ability to model and predict soil fluxes. A robust and widely applicable method for measuring fluxes, therefore, is needed to constrain annual N<sub>2</sub>O budgets and to provide a process-based understanding of measurement variability. Here we discuss the development of an automated chamber system that will allow continuous measurement of N<sub>2</sub>O over a period of weeks to months. Such long-term measurements will improve the accuracy of flux estimates and allow collection of sufficient N<sub>2</sub>O for isotopomer abundance analysis to quantitatively apportion N2O sources. Our chamber design uses a conditioned molecular sieve trap to collect soil-derived N2O that is circulated from the chamber using a diaphragm pump. Prior to contact with the molecular sieve, chamber air is circulated through desiccant and ascarite traps to remove water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>, which compete for N<sub>2</sub>O on molecular sieve. We can demonstrate that N<sub>2</sub>O is absorbed onto molecular sieve and removed efficiently without sample loss or isotopic fractionation. Currently, we are in the field-testing phase and addressing long-term deployment and automation issues. This new chamber system has the potential to become a new tool for soil trace gas measurements that can be easily deployed in a variety of managed and natural ecosystems.

One subgroup, the basidiomycetes, produce enzymes involved in the degradation of lignin and humics and are responsible for the majority of the degradation of lignocellulose plant residues and soil organic matter. Very little is known about their phylogenetic diversity and how this diversity affects ecosystem function.We have studied the occurance of soil basidiomycetes and the diversity of their lignin degrading capabilities on three levels: 1) The occurance of sporocarps as a measure of species richness; 2) The isolation of unique soil basidiomycetes as a measure of species richness with concurrent analysis of the lignin modifying enzymes they produce and; 3) the isolation of basidiomycete DNA from total soil community DNA with the subsequent analyses for both species richness (using 25S rDNA) and the encodement of lignin modifying genes.The first level of our study has resulted in the following basidiomycete species list for KBS:Note that when there are repeats (such as Mycena species) each species is unique.The second level of our study has revealed that as we go from a no-till to a tilled treatment, species richness decreases with a concurrent increase in the occurrence and distribution of lignin modifying enzymes. As we go from a treatment with a lower diversity of plant material inputs (mainly lower heterogeneity) to a treatment with a higher diversity of plant material we see both higher species richness and occurrence of lignin modifying enzymes.The third level of our study is currently underway. Results are too preliminary to make any firm conclusions at this time."

  abstract: Surface accumulations of recently deposited and labile soil C on soil aggregates establish heterogenous C gradients along planes of weakness within soils. Carbon deposited by plant roots were evaluated by the natural abundance of 13C in whole aggregates and peeled fractions from concentric layers of aggregates ranging from 7 - 11 mm across. Surface layers can be peeled from aggregates ranging from 0.5 to 15 mm across by the new soil aggregation erosion (SAE) chambers developed at Michigan State University. Twice as much C is located on surface layers than is within interior regions of soil aggregates from agricultural soils. Following 20 months of alfalfa (C3-C), nearly 80% of newly deposited soil C originated from the concurrent alfalfa crop. Less than 25% of C sequestered within aggregates originated from the alfalfa. New C inputs by corn and rye roots were 0.41 and 1.45 g C kg-1 soil for the 0-5 cm depths. Increased C coupled with N gradients, reported earlier, result in 200% increases in the gradients of C:N from the exterior to interior regions of soil aggregates, Table 1. These and other factors control microbial populations of fungi within soil aggregates of the Kalamazoo loam soil. Fungal biomass, measured by the direct microscopy method, was 40 % greater in the exterior layers of aggregates from the LTER poplar site.Table 1.

  abstract: "The ability to hear and to interpret sound is one of our basic senses. Sounds produced by the environment are an untapped resource to enable humans to assess the health of the ecosystems within which they live or extract resources. The arrays of sounds in a place depend on the habitat type, the mosaic of habitats in the landscape, the time of day, and the season of the year. We have hypothesize that sounds also reflect the status of the ecosystems. Many groups of animals produce sound and use acoustic signals to communicate. Patterns of acoustic signals reflect the dynamics of biological, social, and physical systems in the landscape. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of acoustic signal patterns reflect changes in those dynamics. The exact meaning of these signals, in terms of the processes and interactions they represent between social and bio-physical systems is a challenging area of study. A framework for the study and understanding of patch-level acoustic signals from a landscape is presented. This framework includes a) the definition of a soundscape, b) a taxonomy of the biological and physical characteristics of a soundscape, c) an analytical approach to quantify the components of an acoustic sample taken from the environment, d) a protocol for measurement of acoustic signals in the environment, e) a cyber-infrastructure necessary to manage numerous acoustic signals sampled from different environments, and f) a web tool to present acoustic information in near-real time from different places at different times. Our research has produced methods to characterize acoustics in human dominated ecosystems. Our findings are in three areas: <i>soundscape classification</i>; measurement of <i>diurnal patterns of acoustics</i>, and the development of <i>indices relating human and biophysical acoustics</i>. We present case studies to demonstrate the framework and outcomes of some monitoring and measurements of environmental acoustics."

  abstract: "Acoustical analysis procedures are being developed for ecosystem assessment. The objective of this project was to determine if acoustics could be used to evaluate soil aggregate stability and porosity. Soil aggregates were placed on the surface of water in a 250 ml corrugated glass container in a sound chamber. This was repeated four times for each treatment. The resulting acoustics were recorded with a hydrophone and analyzed using the Gage EAS and modified Matlab computer programs designed to produce sonograms and graphic representations of acoustical frequencies and intensities. Soils used in a first experiment where from a KBS native ecosystem, Wooster forest site, and Hoytville continuously tilled agricultural site. The first experiment was modified and repeated, with more repetitions and treatments added in a second experiment. In the second experiment, Wooster soil came from a continuously tilled site, a no-till agricultural site, and a native forest site. Hoytville soil was from two agricultural sites: continuously tilled and no-till. KBS soil from the native ecosystem was also used. Soils with disruptive management practices involving tillage had greater sound intensity and variability; whereas soils from natural ecosystems where silent and had less within sample variability. The results from both experiments were similar. We conclude that tilled soils are heterogeneous, with a mix of unstable and stable soil aggregates. Overall, conventionally tilled soils have less soil aggregate stability and greater sound intensity. Soils from natural ecosystems are homogeneous and the soil has high soil aggregate stability and less sound intensity. Our results indicated that acoustics can be a useful and rapid way to determine soil aggregate stability."

  abstract: Although it is often suggested that crop yields in conventionally managed agricultural systems are less stable from year to year than those in organic and reduced-input systems, there have been few studies that have directly examined this issue. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of agricultural management systems on the annual variability of crop yields over a 14 year period in a long-term cropping systems experiment at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station LTER in Michigan. Crops were corn, soybean, and winter wheat grown in a three-year rotation under conventional (CT), no-till (NT), low-input (LI), and organic (ORG) management. Crop yields were measured each year, and crop yield variability was estimated using the coefficient of variation calculated separately for each crop phase of the rotation from 1993 to 2004. Mean yields for each crop phase were similar in CT, NT, and LI, and of higher magnitude than in ORG. There was a strong rotation phase by management system interaction on crop yield variability. Crop yield variability was lowest in CT and NT winter wheat and highest in ORG soybean. Results of this study suggest that, despite previous observations, crop yields in organic management systems are not always more stable than those in conventional systems. No-till and reduced input management systems perform comparably to conventional systems over the longer-term, both in terms of yields and annual yield variability.

  abstract: Soil aggregates are the primary reservoirs of carbon (C) in the soil. Greater quantities of C, from root and plant exudates and decomposing plant residues accumulate at aggregate surfaces and can be moved into aggregate interiors by repeated wetting and drying cycles.&nbsp; As intra-aggregate pore networks increase and more C moves inward, aggregates become more stable. These feed back mechanisms increase internal sequestration of soil C. &nbsp;Accumulations of C and N compounds on aggregate surfaces increase hydrophobic properties at aggregates. &nbsp;Respiration rates by whole intact aggregates from CT treatments were nearly 2-fold greater than soils from exterior regions of aggregates from Forest and NT whole aggregates.&nbsp; In contrast, respiration rates by soils from interior regions of CT aggregates were 70% of NT interiors. &nbsp;These flux rates and subsequent biogeochemical processes influence different microbial populations at surfaces and within aggregates.&nbsp; Management practices that promote these processes could dramatically increase both the strengths of aggregates and the rates of C deposition and retention.

  abstract: Soil basidiomycetes isolated from KBS were examined for the distribution and relative abundance&Otilde;s of lignin peroxidase, (LIP), manganese dependent peroxidase (MNP) and laccase (LAC). The abundance&Otilde;s of these ligninolytic enzymes produced by 25 isolates were correlated to two soil treatments; physical perturbation (tillage) and diversity (species richness and heterogeneity) of plant material inputs. LAC was produced by 90% of all isolates. MNP was produced by 40% of all isolates. No isolates produced LIPs although the potential for the production was evidenced through molecular probing. 75% of all isolates from the tilled soils produced LAC in vitro and 62.5% produced MNP. 40% of the isolates from the no-till soils produced LAC in vitro and 33.3% produced MNP. 82.5% of the isolates from the successional plant treatment soils produced LAC in vitro and 62.5% produced MNP. These data support the hypotheses that basidiomycetes isolated from a physically disturbed site have a higher distribution of ligininolytic enzymes than isolates from a non-disturbed site and basidiomycetes isolated from a soil with a high diversity of plant material inputs have a higher distribution of ligninolytic enzymes than those isolated from a soil with a lesser diversity of plant material inputs.Return to Contents

We also compared these C and N contents with mean weight diameter (MWD) indices of aggregate stability responses to wet sieving, their textural compositions, and their saturated hydraulic conductivities (Ks).&nbsp; We observed 2.2 and 1.6-fold greater C contents in NT macro- aggregates compared to CT aggregates from Wooster silt loam and Hoytville clay loam soils. Carbon contents were positively correlated with aggregate stability and intra-aggregate porosities. There were no significant gradients of C between concentric layers of NT and NF macro-aggregates, whereas C concentrations in exterior layers of CT aggregates from Wooster and Hoytville soil series were 36% and 8% greater than their interior layers. Both greater gradients and increasing total C in macro-aggregates were parallel with increasing porosities within concentric layers, whole aggregate stabilities, and the Ks values within aggregates of each soil type.&nbsp; These results indicate that C migration into macro-aggregates is influenced by the development and the stabilization of intra-aggregate pores that appear from increased microbial activity and accelerated influxes of SOC and cations into aggregate interiors during multiple wetting-drying cycles.

  abstract: The Kellogg Biological Station cropping system LTER presents an experimental framework to consider the importance of habitat affinity of aphid parasitoids and predatory flies as they adapt to utilizing an aphid invading the US Midwest field crop system. Within 3 yr of the invasion of Aphis glycines, the soybean aphid, we found a diverse group of resident parasitoids and predatory flies utilizing A. glycines as host/prey. Species diversity was similar to the community known to regulate A. glycines in its home range, but at the KBS LTER no greater than 1% parasitism of soybean aphid occurred, predation by flies was detected, and aphid outbreaks were pronounced. In 2004 and 2005, we measured habitat affinity of these aphid-specialists by placing sentinel A. glycines in soybean, other field crops, and noncropped vegetation at the KBS LTER. Overall, the predatory fly fauna utilizing A. glycines in soybean was about the same or only modestly lower in species number and abundance than in other habitats. In contrast, habitat affinity of the parasitoids was more pronounced as measured by differences in parasitoid abundance between the habitats. The habitat data bode well for predatory flies preying on A. glycines in soybean, but stronger habitat affinity of parasitoids likely presents additional challenges as they adapt to use of an invading species.

  abstract: "Agronomic yield is evaluated for each of the annually tilled cropping systems each year. The annual cropped systems are in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation. In 1998, the annual cropping systems treatment rotated into wheat. The annual cropped treatments are replicated six times and include Treatment 1, CT-Conventional Chemical Input/Conventional Tilled, Treatment 2, NT-Conventional Chemical Input/No Tillage, Treatment 3, LI-Low Chemical Input/Conventional Tillage, and Treatment 4, ZI-Zero Chemical Input/Conventional Tillage. Treatment 5 (Poplars) were harvested in the early spring of 1999. The trees were chipped and weighed at the KBS Dairy. Treatment 6 (alfalfa) was replanted to a Leaf Hopper Resistant variety this spring.Differences in annual cropping systems and how each is managed influence final grain yield (<a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig1.htm\">Fig. 1</a>). Since 1996 grain yields on the LTER Main site have been estimated using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS system uses 24 earth orbiting satellites to determine the JD 4425 Combines location during the harvesting operation with sub-meter accuracy. The coordinates are added to yield information in 1 second intervals and this data is used to generate yield maps following the harvesting operation. The yield monitor within the combine is connected to various electronic sensors within the combine and is calibrated prior to harvest for each crop. The yield monitor gives accurate on the go information to the combine operator during the harvest operation and this data is recorded and downloaded to a computer at the end of each harvest day. In 1998, all four treatments were evaluated for wheat yield across all six replicates; grain weights compared to actual grain weight by plot had generally less than 2% error. In 1996-corn , 1997-soybean and 1998 wheat harvests, the first four replicates of all four treatments were recorded (some of reps 5 and 6) using the yield monitor. The 1996 yield monitor data has been corrected for moisture and grain yield by plot and re-mapped. The 1996 &ndash; 1998 GIS yield monitoring data is available on the LTER web page and include geo-statistical analysis of this spatial data and are available at: http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/Yield_Data/index.html. Yield monitoring base data, frequency distributions, variograms, kriged data, cross validation of kriged data, isopleth map, and the GS+ file are available for each LTER plot where real-time corrected GIS data was collected and can be viewed at this site.The JD 4425 combine will be available for demonstration and yield maps for Treatment 3, Replicate 3 for 1996-corn, 1997-soybean, and 1998-wheat appear in <a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig2.htm\">Fig. 2</a> and in <a href=\"Figures/halvorson_fig3.htm\">Fig. 3</a>. These maps demonstrate similar yield trends for yields at a location and across years for different crops. These spatial similarities for yield show how changes in soil type influences final grain yields and these differences can also be picked up by looking at the low level infrared fly-over photographs taken each year prior to harvest."

Two reservoirs of differing trophic status were sampled weekly in order to quantify the roles of the reservoirs as sinks for nutrients. Lake Allegan is a 1587-acre hypereutrophic impoundment, and is located 43 miles downstream of Morrow Lake, a 1000- acre eutrophic impoundment on the same river. No major tributary inputs exist between the reservoirs. Despite their spatial proximity, in 1999 a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for phosphorus was developed for Lake Allegan to control summer algal blooms, whereas Morrow Pond lacks summer algal blooms.&nbsp; The inflow and outflow waters of Lake Allegan and Morrow Pond were sampled and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus, major solutes and chlorophyll. The biogeochemical changes in river water during passage through the reservoirs will be analyzed, and the two systems will be compared.

  abstract: "Four KBS/LTER ecosystems where monitored in 2005 for their acoustical properties. Hydrophones where placed 30 cm above ground and on the soil surface in the: conventionally tilled corn-soybean rotation, organic-tilled corn soybean rotation, coniferous forest and deciduous forest ecosystems. The acoustical signatures were recorded on laptop computers, at 6 a.m., 9 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., 8:30 p.m. and midnight. Each recording was done for 30 seconds and repeated seven times for four days in late August. At midnight there were differences between the above ground sounds of the forest and the agricultural ecosystems. At midnight, the forest ecosystems where full of insect sounds such as: tree crickets, cicadas and katydids, while the agricultural ecosystems where equally silent throughout the day and night. There were no differences among the four ecosystems for the acoustical signatures at the soil surface, probably because of the lack of a specific activation event. To test this hypothesis, the acoustics of compost and sterilized compost where analyzed in the presence and absence of water used as a pulsing agent. Compost (200 cm3) with its natural biota (earthworms, isopods, collembola, staphilinid beetles, nematodes and other microscopic organisms) was placed in two 400 ml glass containers. One was sterilized by placing it in a microwave for 2 minutes. A hydrophone was place on a 35&#9675; angle on the surface of both containers and the sounds recorded for 30 seconds in a sound chamber. This was repeated five times. Subsequently, 50 ml of water was added to both composts and the resulting acoustics recorded for 30 seconds five times. With the addition of water the non-microwaved compost became active and the sound intensity increased significantly compared to the three other treatments. We concluded that soil is a place where organism are often dormant and can be activated with a pulsing agent such as water. In summary we conclude that different ecosystems have different acoustical temporal dimensions, that acoustics can be a useful, nondestructive tool to access ecosystem biodiversity and that acoustics is a useful and nondestructive method for evaluating soil biological activity."

  abstract: Two hypotheses for how the immense diversity in soil bacterial communities is maintained are 1. high habitat diversity 2. low competition due to dormancy of cells. We hypothesized that the light fraction (LF) is a unique microbial habitat analogous to the rhizosphere. LF is a rapidly-cycling soil carbon pool isolated through density separation and sieving. Soil samples were taken from KBS LTER alfalfa plots and Living Field Lab continuous corn, conventional management plots. Samples were sieved to isolate 1. rhizosphere 2. shoot residue &gt;2mm and 3. bulk soil. Bulk soil was then separated into LF and heavy fraction (HF, soil aggregates and other minerals) by centrifugation in water. Bacterial T-RFLP fingerprints were obtained by DNA extraction from each fraction, followed by PCR amplification with fluorescently-labeled eubacterial primers, and restriction with HhaI. Total bacterial population sizes and populations within cell size classes were determined by digital image analysis of soil smears stained with DTAF.<font size="2">Soil bacterial populations were highest in soil fractions where freshly deposited substrate is concentrated (<a href="Figures/blackwood_figure_1.htm">carbon hotspots, Figure 1</a>). This phenomenon is more general than the rhizosphere-effect, including LF and shoot residue. The communities of hotspots contained an increased number of large cells, indicative of increased activity. But the proportion of CTC-active cells was constant across soil fractions. Further studies need to be performed to determine the level of activity of soil bacterial cells and the location of the most active cells. Substrate availability had a large impact on bacterial community composition (</font><a href="Figures/blackwood_figure_2.htm"><font size="2">Figure 2</font></a><font size="2">). Hotspot communities were very different from bulk soil communities. In addition, LF and shoot residue communities were nearly identical but distinct from the rhizosphere. Cropping history also caused divergence of communities within each habitat type. A wide diversity of habitats is likely to be found in soils, particularly those with more heterogeneous plant assemblages.</font>Soil bacterial populations were highest in soil fractions where freshly deposited substrate is concentrated (<a href="Figures/blackwood_figure_1.htm">carbon hotspots, Figure 1</a>).

  abstract: Stable soil aggregates preserve intra-aggregate porosities that do not collapse during wetting and drying cycles. Stable micropore networks increase the retention of carbon which feeds back into the formation of more stable aggregates. We investigated aggregate stability by wet sieving and by polar tensile strength crushing resistances of aggregates from agricultural ecosystems in two Hoytville and Wooster soil series. Carbon contents, textural distributions, and intra-aggregate porosities were compared. Soil carbon contents in aggregates from no tillage (NT) systems were 1.6 and 2.2 fold greater than conventional tillage (CT) systems from Hoytville and Wooster, respectively. Water stability of soil aggregates increased with increasing C content and became most stable as C contents exceeded 4%. C content and water stability of aggregates showed positive correlations with intra-aggregate porosities that decreased by 6-7% in CT aggregates. Polar tensile strength of dry aggregates increased with increasing bulk density, C, and clay content. These results suggest that non-disrupted and higher intra-aggregate porosities retained more internal carbon. This is indirect evidence of accelerated organo-clay mineral interactions.

  abstract: Aphid-specialist enemies in soybean and surrounding habitats (alfalfa, corn, wheat-clover, and non-crop vegetation) were evaluated for their potential to attack Aphis glycines, the invasive soybean aphid. A substantial group of aphid-enemies, 8 parasitoids and 8 predatory flies, attacked A. glycines that were artificially placed in soybean and other habitats commonly found in soybean production areas. Habitat fidelity of the enemies varied. Of the parasitoids, <i>Lysiphlebus testaceipes</i> was the most common attacking A. glycines. It was found in most habitats including soybean and became abundant when A. glycines populations peaked. An undescribed Binodoxys (new species) was readily able to parasitize A. glycines, but almost exclusively in noncrop vegetation. And the parasitoid <i>Aphelinus albipodus</i> rarely parasitized A. glycines in all habitats visited but readily parasitized <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> on corn. Predatory flies as a whole more frequently attacked A. glycines than parasitoids. The cecidomyiid, <i>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</i>, was particularly abundant. Predatory flies were less habitat specific compared with parasitoids, although selected syrphid species appeared to have considerable habitat fidelity. Overall, the enemy fauna utilizing A. glycines on soybean was lower in species number (5 parasitoids and 6 predatory flies) and abundance for some species (up to 90% lower) compared with the enemy fauna utilizing A. glycines that was artificially placed in alfalfa, corn, wheat-clover, and non-crop vegetation.

  abstract: A number of recent experimental studies in grasslands have shown that plant diversity can have important effects on a number of community and ecosystem processes.&nbsp; We have recently established an experiment at the KBS LTER in which cropping system diversity is manipulated by varying the number of crops in a row-crop rotation and the use of cover crops.&nbsp; The twenty experimental treatments in the &#8220;Biodiversity Plots Experiment&#8221; were established in 2000 and span a realistic range of crop diversities including no-crop fallows (spring and fall-tilled), single species monocultures (continuous corn, soybean, and winter wheat), two-crop (corn-soybean, wheat-soybean) and three-crop rotations (corn-soybean-wheat), with and without cover crops.&nbsp; All treatments are managed without chemical inputs.&nbsp; We have been monitoring the effects of cropping system diversity on the associate weed communities by sampling the soil seed bank (early May, just after spring crops are planted) and emergent weed community (biomass harvest in late August).&nbsp; Interestingly, cropping system diversity (e.g. the number of crops in the rotation or use of cover crops) had little effect on weed seed densities, emergent weed biomass, species richness, or species evenness. Multivariate analysis of emergent weed community composition among treatments revealed that weed communities in fall fallows and winter wheat treatments are distinct from those in spring-sown crops and fallows.&nbsp; These results suggest that initial differences in weed community composition associated with cropping system diversity are driven by differences in tillage time (fall vs. spring) and that the timing of management activities is initially a more important factor than rotational diversity in determining weed community composition and structure in row-crop systems.

  abstract: The ability to sequester carbon in the soil is influenced by many factors i.e., management practices, topographical factors and inherent soil properties. Among the factors influencing magnitude and direction of long-term management effects are soil C levels prior to management implementation. We assume that the sequestration rate will be higher in the soil with low initial carbon than in the soil with high initial carbon. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between initial carbon content and the soil carbon sequestration potential under different crop management practices 18 years after experiment implementation. We compared three management systems, namely, chisel plowed tillage (CT) and no-till with conventional chemical inputs (NT), and a certified organic chisel plowed system with a winter leguminous cover crop and zero chemical inputs (CT+cover) from a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site located at Kellogg Biological Station, southwest Michigan, established in 1988. A set of 417 total C measurements obtained from the experimental site in 1987 prior to the experiment establishment serves as a baseline data in this study. In 2006, using GPS we identified 50 of the 1988 sampling sites that were located well within the boundaries of CT, CT+Cover crop and NT treatment plots and carried out soil sampling using hydraulic soil core unit. The data were first analyzed using separate regressions for each treatment with initial C as an independent variable and the change in C values from 1988 to 2006 as a dependant variable and then, the interaction effect between initial carbon and different management systems were studied using ANCOVA. Effects of treatments and initial carbon levels on total C gains and losses will be presented and discussed.

  abstract: The nitrous oxide mole ratio (N<sub>2</sub>O / [N<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>]) represents the fraction of denitrification that results in N<sub>2</sub>O, a radiatively active trace gas that contributes to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The ratio is difficult to investigate because of high spatial and temporal variability and because of the difficulty in making direct measurements of N<sub>2</sub> flux from soil. We collected soil from three replicate 1-ha plots for each of two ecosystems -- conventionally-tilled, high-input corn-wheat-soy rotation ('cropped') and 10-year-old native succession -- at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station LTER site. Soil was sieved, air-dried, and incubated in jars for 24 hours with nitrate (<sup>15</sup>N-labeled or unlabeled), glucose, and water (85% water-filled pore space) to stimulate denitrification. One set of jars received 80% of total water 48 hours before the start of the incubation. Gas chromatography (GC) with acetylene inhibition was used to assess N<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub> production. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) was used to assess N<sub>2</sub> production and to estimate non-destructively the enrichment of the soil nitrate pool. For soil from cropped sites, mean N<sub>2</sub>O mole ratios measured by gas chromatography were 0.36 for the 'pre-wet' incubations and 0.90 for controls. For successional sites, ratios were 0.34 for pre-wet soils and 0.33 for controls. By ANOVA, the mean for cropped-site controls was significantly different from the others. There was a significant interaction of ecosystem and recent moisture history (P = 0.012). We attribute the interaction to differences in the abilities of the soils to maintain the status of the denitrifying enzyme nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). Apparently Nos status was maintained rather well in the successional soils, but declined with drying in the cropped soils and was re-induced quickly with the onset of anaerobic conditions. For N<sub>2</sub> production, IRMS methods gave estimates that were about 0.34 of GC estimates. Yet estimates of enrichment of the soil mineral pool using N<sub>2</sub> data agree well with those from N<sub>2</sub>O data and with mass-balance predictions. At present, we cannot explain unequivocally the discrepancy between the methods.

  abstract: "Pioneer families in Southwest Michigan (SWMI) commonly cultivated European varieties and/or gathered indigenous fruit for the household.&nbsp; By the mid-1800s the area was formally recognized as an important location for commercial production. This region, particularly along the coast, benefits from the moderating effects of Lake Michigan which delays autumn frosts, provides heavy winter snows that prevent the ground from freezing, and creates relatively warmer air temperatures.&nbsp; Receding glaciers left a rolling terrain that permits cool air drainage, reducing the number and severity of damaging frosts, and sandy, loamy, well-drained soils. As a result of the variety of native fruits and berries it is assumed that indigenous insects and diseases already existed. In the last 1800s growers began using various technologies (e.g., agrichemicals, sprayers) to facilitate the yield and quality necessary for both fresh and processing markets.The industry took shape throughout the 1860s and 70s, following the opening of a wholesale market and the extension of both shipping and rail transportation. With the advent of refrigerated rail (mid-1880s) SWMI experienced intense competition from the Pacific Coast. Continued production, even today, is linked to many socio-cultural phenomena including: 1) an appeal to health and wellbeing that influenced overall consumption; 2) the opening of canning companies and food manufacturers, as well as the and development of new foods (e.g., fruit paste used in cereal bars; 3) expanded marketing; and 4) growers' political activism (e.g., securing state funding for research). Lastly, fruit has been iconized over time and space. At the local level it is celebrated with various forms of agritainment, in the naming of roads and communities, and with seasonal events. For the general public it has become a symbol of agriculture and its production the definition of &#8220;ruralness&#8221; and &#8220;nature.&#8221;"

  abstract: How important are plant species in influencing the structure and function of soil microbial communities? We attempted to answer this question by examining the structure and composition of soil microbial communities from six old fields at the Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan that differed in plant species composition, productivity, and soil characteristics. Aboveground productivity ranged from 188 to 592 g/m<sup>2</sup> across sites, while plant species density ranged from 2 to 16 species/m<sup>2</sup>. We grew a common plant species, <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>, in each soil to determine if this influenced the composition and activity of the soil community. Plants were grown for 110 days in the greenhouse. We measured plant performance in each soil type and also compared how soil characteristics (e.g. moisture, percent organic matter, nitrogen) and the activity and composition of the soil microbial community differed in the presence and absence of <i>A. gerardi</i>. We assessed the composition of the soil microbial community using Ecolog and PLFA. Soils differed in fertility and this affected plant biomass and allocation patterns. In both the <img src="http://199.245.200.35/images/charent/MATH/plusmn.gif" height="12" width="15" /><i>A. gerardi</i> treatments, soils differed in microbial activity and PLFA patterns. The presence of <i>A. gerardi</i> increased the mean, but decreased the variation, in microbial activity among soils. In addition, soils from + <i>A. gerardi</i> treatments differed in PLFA patterns from the no plant controls. This suggests that plant species composition can affect the composition and activity of the soil microbial community.

  abstract: Soil microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) are responsible for processes such as decomposition, recycling and mineralization of organic residues. Homobasidiomycetes are the group of fungal organisms that act as dominant recyclers of plant residue in soil. Soil saprobic Homobasidiomycetes have significant ligninolytic abilities because of their production of lignin-modifying enzymes. Diversity estimates for saprotrophic Basidiomycetes in the soil are based mostly on observations of their fruiting bodies above ground. Basidiomycetes in the soil are under-represented in soil microbial surveys due to the difficulties associated with isolating them in pure culture. Slow growing soil Homobasidiomycetes are not readily recovered using standard isolation techniques because of competition from rapidly growing Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes. However, incorporation of the fungicide Benomyl into the medium allows for selective isolation of saprotrophic Basidiomycetes from soil through culturing. Two different culturing approaches (directly from soil and from wooden baits) were used in attempt to selectively isolate saprotrophic basidiomycetes from soil.The goal of my research is to determine the communities of soil saprotrophic Basidiomycetes in selected treatments of KBS-LTER that can be cultured directly from soil or from wooden baits. The second goal of this research is to determine whether the different approaches of culturing from soil and wooden baits or DNA extraction from soil (done by Lynch and Bahnmann on same selected treatments of KBS-LTER soil) favour detection of certain Basidiomycetes.

An upgraded CMEIAS v3.0 is being developed to extract 5 ecologically relevant parameters of microbial communities <i>in situ</i> in digital images: (i) classify their morphological diversity at a complexity level equivalent to 98% of the genera described in Bergey&#8217;s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, (ii) measure microbial abundance based on cell density, biovolume and biomass carbon, (iii) quantify microbial metabolic activity based on color recognition, (iv) analyze microbial autecology and phylogeny based on color recognition using molecular probes, and (v) analyze spatial patterns of microbial colonization at single-cell resolution. CMEIAS output data can also be exported into EcoStat and GS+ Geostatistics to compute additional ecological statistics that further characterize microbial community structure. Recent developments for CMEIAS v3.0 are as follows:Three image segmentation tools have been built to edit images for analysis in ImageTool. A stand-alone CMEIAS <b>Color Recognition</b> program interactively samples up to 200 color pixels of the microbes of interest, then finds each cell&#8217;s boundary and finally creates a new RGB image with these colored microbes surrounded by a noise-free background. This new program has an overall accuracy of 96.7% and will likely revolutionize the <i>in situ</i> quantitative image analysis of bacteria differentiated by color for immunofluorescence, FISH, total abundance and metabolic activity. <b>Action Palette Sequences</b> operating in Adobe Photoshop have been built to edit foreground and background pixels in typical images of microbes acquired using phase contrast LM, fluorescence microscopy and SEM, and these actions perform with an overall accuracy of 97.1%. A CMEIAS <b>Object Separation</b> plugin operating in ImageTool automatically splits touching microbial cells before image analysis and has an overall accuracy of 95.8%.Three CMEIAS macros have been developed to prepare and compute image analysis data imported into MS Excel. The <b>Data Preparation</b> macro compiles, concatenates, and graphically displays object analysis and classification data, preparing them for further analysis by ecological statistics. The <b>Sampling Statistics</b> macro analyzes datasets containing multiple images to determine if the sample size is sufficient to estimate community morphotype diversity. The <b>Action Performance</b> macro computes performance accuracy for newly developed action sequences by analyzing object analysis and morphotype classification data extracted from the corresponding edited images of microbes.Several new CMEIAS measurement features of object analysis have been developed to analyze microbial abundance and spatial distribution patterns <i>in situ</i>. Eight out of 18 different <b>Microbial Biovolume</b> formulas have been identified as most accurate and implemented to measure this cell abundance parameter for all microbial morphotypes recognized by CMEIAS. A CMEIAS <b>Cluster Index</b> has been introduced to measure the proximity of aggregated cells surrounding each individual microbe as a Z variate for geostatistical spatial distribution analyses of colonization behavior in microbial biofilms. A CMEIAS <b>Size Border</b> tool analyzes cell size data and returns the upper and lower border limits of their optimized cell size clusters for classification of Operational Morphotype Units. Two CMEIAS script macros have been built to perform quadrat-based spatial distribution analyses of microbes colonizing surfaces. One script provides a transparent grid overlay of the image to be analyzed, and the second reports the area of the AOI polygon for cumulative object analysis.Recent projects using CMEIAS in the Dazzo lab include <i>in situ</i> microbial community analyses of corn leaf surfaces (normal vs. genetically engineered BT-corn), soil aggregates, Japanese freshwater streams, pristine Italian Alpine lakes, plus autecological biogeography of rice growth-promoting rhizobia and measurements of the calling distances and spatial gradients for quorum sensing cell-to-cell communication during microbial colonization of roots.Our vision is for CMEIAS to become an accurate, robust and user-friendly software tool that can significantly enhance the analysis of whole community samples without cultivation, thereby creating many new applications for quantitative studies of <i>in situ</i> microbial ecology at spatial scales relevant to the microbes themselves."

  abstract: Organic matter is a key contributor to the formation, function, and stability of soil aggregates.&nbsp; Recent research in our laboratory has shown that gradients in total C content frequently occur from the surfaces to centers of soil aggregates.&nbsp; However, measurements of total C provide no specific information about the changes in the nature of soil C compounds.&nbsp; Therefore, additional information is needed to better define the composition of organic materials within soil aggregates.Determination of the size of soil organic C pools, based on their turnover rates, provides valuable information describing the nature of soil organic matter.&nbsp; the use of first-order kinetics and a three pool model has been shown to ban an effective method for describing soil organic matter dynamics (Paul et al., 2000).&nbsp; These pools are frequently referred to as active, slow, and resistant.&nbsp; the active pool is comprised of the most labile C compounds with residence times in soil of a few days to a few years.&nbsp; the slow pool contains moderately available C compounds with residence times ranging from a few to 100 years.&nbsp; The resistant pool contains highly recalcitrant C compounds with residence times of hundreds to thousands of years.&nbsp; A combination of acid hydrolysis and carbon mineralization measurements provide the data necessary to quantify the size of the three pools and turnover rates for the active and slow pools.Measurement of <sup>13</sup>C content in respired CO<sub>2</sub> provides information about the age and source of C in SOM.&nbsp; Plants using C3 and C4 photosynthesis discriminate against the fixation of <sup>13</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub> to different degrees.&nbsp; Therefore, SOM derived from C4 plant material have distinctly different <sup>13</sup>C contents than those derived from C3 plants.&nbsp; At sites where the current vegetation uses a photosynthetic pathway which contrasts that used by the previous vegetation, <sup>13</sup>C content in respired CO<sub>2</sub> reflects the proportions of C derived from each plant source.

  abstract: Most wetlands exhibit seasonal water level fluctuations as a result of winter and spring hydrologic inputs and summer drydown by evapotranspiration. In addition to the seasonal dynamics, climatic variation can produce marked interannual variability. We monitored water levels in a set of wetlands in southwestern Michigan that spans the range of hydrologic conditions common to the area. Measurements began in 1996 or 1998, and the region has experienced exceptionally dry conditions since 1998. The cumulative effects of multiple years of below-average precipitation and high summer evaporation rates explain the recent water level declines. On a seasonal time scale, water source information is a strong determinant of wetland water level fluctuations; more groundwater-fed wetlands exhibit less within-year variability than more precipitation-fed wetlands. Interannual water level variability is better explained by a measure of landscape position. Wetlands located farthest from the Kalamazoo River, the regional topographic low, have exhibited the most substantial water level decreases. Exceptionally high precipitation in May 2000 has partly alleviated some of the recent drought effects. A 43-year water level record for a local lake provides an historical context for the recent drydown event, demonstrating that local water levels in late 1999 were lower than they had been in over 30 years. On annual time scales, the existence of significant groundwater inputs confers hydrologic stability to some local wetland systems. However, landscape position is a much stronger predictor of which wetlands will dry down most during drought periods.

  abstract: Because of the strong negative impacts invasive species can have on native biodiversity and ecosystem function, it is important to be able to predict where non-natives are most likely to invade and thrive.&nbsp; Long term data sets provide a unique opportunity to study invasion dynamics in relation to changes in species diversity and productivity.&nbsp; A graduate student working group at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) is evaluating patterns of invasion across six LTER grassland sites as a function of diversity and productivity of those sites.&nbsp; For the KBS successional old field sites, we found that invasibility (number of new species colonizing a site) declined over time, but that invasion impact (biomass of invasive species) increased over time. Across all sites, we found that while high diversity sites are more likely to be invaded, low diversity sites may experience greater changes in ecosystem processes as a result of non-native species.

  abstract: <font size="2">We are beginning some experiments to identify environmental and biological controls on nitrous oxide flux from soils. Nitrous oxide, an important radiatively-active trace gas in the upper atmosphere, is a potential contributor to global climate change (IPCC 1992). In soils, nitrous oxide is generated primarily by denitrification and nitrification. Denitrifiers reduce nitrate to nitrous oxide or (more completely) to dinitrogen. The mole ratio of nitrous oxide flux to dinitrogen flux is highly variable both temporally and spatially. N2O flux from soils depends (at least in part) on net denitrification rate and on the N2O mole ratio (cf. Firestone and Davidson 1989) . All though controls on denitrification rates are fairly well understood (e.g. Groffman and Tiedje 1989), controls on N2O flux are not. We hope to contribute to the success of N2O models by characterizing proximal controls on the N2O ratio.</font><font size="2">Our general approach is to use 15-N labeling and mass spectrometry to quantify N2 and N2O simultaneously. Lab incubations of soil cores will be used to explore the effects of WFPS, pO2, C:NO3-, etc., and to test the results in the field using modified chamber techniques. We expect to see a distinct trend in N2O ratio following real or simulated rainfall events. We will conduct other experiments to explore the effects of microbial community diversity and N2O production by nitrifiers.</font><font size="2">About half of the sources in the global N2O budget (needed to balance known sinks) are missing. Evidence suggests that land-use conversion (e.g., cultivation) may function as a long-term source of global N2O (<a href="Bergsma%20Figure%201.htm">Figure 1</a>). Thus it is especially important to understand N2O flux in the agricultural context. The diversity of KBS treatments and controls will allow for rigorous tests of the hypotheses developed in this project.</font>

  abstract: As interest in sustainable agriculture increases among Extension and agency personnel, training materials are needed to help increase understanding of the ecological principles that are at the heart of sustainable agriculture. With the assistance of these end users, we have developed a training manual that presents ecological principles in an agricultural context. Topics include an introduction to field crop ecology, an overview of soil ecosystems, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, cover crop ecology, the ecology and management of insects (beneficials and pests), and nematode ecology and management. Recent research results on the benefits of crop rotation and cover crops are highlighted, including results from the KBS LTER site. While examples are specific to field crops in the Michigan environment, the principles discussed are applicable to many agricultural situations. By involving farmers and Extension and other agency personnel in the development of this publication, we have facilitated greater understanding of ecological principles and adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. Training sessions using this manual are currently being conducted.Return to Contents

  abstract: Ecological management of agricultural systems requires a thorough understanding of the biological process that drive crop productivity. Insect predation constitutes a major biological process affected by environmental and management factors that fluctuate over several years. Long term studies of these organisms requires separation of long-term patterns from short-term patterns to discriminate between intrinsic and extrinsic causes of population fluctuations. The objective of our research has been to characterize long-term and short-term patterns of interactions between a group of predators (Coccinellids) and habitats typical in agricultural landscapes. A monitoring network of 210 sites has been placed since 1989 at geopositioned permanent locations in the KBS-LTER Main Site. Sampling has been conducted weekly from May to August of each year. This 12 year synthesis documents patterns of coccinellid species response to habitats in an agricultural landscape including the succession of species in Populus, the fluctuations of species diversity in secondary succession, the dominance of exotic species and their potential impact on native species, and the effect of agronomic management on species abundance/activity. Our results indicate that plant diversity impacts differently predator abundance depending on the spatial and temporal scale which (from field to landscape and from one season to several years).

  abstract: Coarse soils require close attention to managing soil carbon and nitrogen (N) mineralization dynamics to optimize nutrient efficiency while maintaining productivity. A long-term cropping system trial underway at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in Michigan provides insights into the impact of cover crops on soluble nitrogen fertilizer requirements in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation. Monitoring of soil carbon, N, water status and plant productivity over 11 years provided insights into transition years and later years of a long-term test of integrated organic and inorganic N management. A reduced requirement for soluble N application was observed over time in treatments with winter cover crops. The markedly low rate of N fertilizer (0 to 30% of the conventional system rate of 145 kg N per ha) applied to cereals in the reduced treatments with cover crops was associated with a steady increase in soil inorganic N supply over time.&nbsp; Productivity of reduced N input systems increased over time, in close association with soil inorganic N status. Cereal yield in the initial years of the trial (1993-1998) was reduced by an average of 11% in the low input system and 48% in the zero input system, compared to the conventionally managed systems. The later years of the trial (1999-2004) saw cereal yields equalize in the low input system with conventional systems, and a more modest yield reduction of 17% was observed in the zero input system. Nitrogen efficiency for all systems was calculated by comparing cereal yield to N added as fertilizer and estimated additions from cover crop (red clover) biological N fixation. Marked N efficiency is observed over time for corn in the low input system, where yield per N input is two-fold higher than conventional and no-till systems.&nbsp; Soil N accumulation and losses from leaching and gaseous losses require further evaluation in this long-term systems trial to understand the cascading and long-term effects of organic amendments on N management recommendations.

  abstract: "Nitrous oxide is well known as a greenhouse gas that has been increasing in concentration in the atmosphere over the past 150 years in a manner similar to carbon dioxide and methane.&nbsp; Microbial nitrification and denitrification are the predominant sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, however, the relative importance of these two processes in the flux of this gas have proven elusive.&nbsp; Such information will be particularly valuable in agricultural environments that can be managed to foster one process or the other.&nbsp; Our laboratory has investigated the use of isotopomers as a potential indicator of the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification in nitrous oxide production.&nbsp; The term &#8220;isotopomer&#8221; refers to not only the isotopic abundance of nitrous oxide (d<sup><font size=\"2\">15</font></sup><font size=\"2\">N and</font>15N andd<sup><font size=\"2\">18</font></sup><font size=\"2\">O) but also to the <sup>15</sup>N abundance within each of the nitrogen atoms comprising this molecule.&nbsp; Recently we demonstrated that the isotopomer composition of nitrous oxide can be used to understand pathways of production by the nitrifying bacteria <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> and <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> Bath (Sutka et al., 2003).&nbsp; We combine these results with experiments using laboratory cultures of whole soil microbes and pure cultures of an N<sub>2</sub>O-producing denitrifier, <i>Pseudomonas</i> <i>chlororaphis</i> (ATCC #43928) to demonstrate that the isotopomer fingerprint of N<sub>2</sub>O derived from denitrification is unique from other that of nitrification.&nbsp; Furthermore, we have demonstrated that in agricultural soils the consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O during denitrification has no affect on site preference.&nbsp; With these results we are now poised to begin to apply isotopomers to apportion the relative contribution of N<sub>2</sub>O derived from nitrification and denitrification in agricultural soils and other environments. &nbsp;</font>18O) but also to the <sup>15</sup>N abundance within each of the nitrogen atoms comprising this molecule.&nbsp; Recently we demonstrated that the isotopomer composition of nitrous oxide can be used to understand pathways of production by the nitrifying bacteria <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> and <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> Bath (Sutka et al., 2003).&nbsp; We combine these results with experiments using laboratory cultures of whole soil microbes and pure cultures of an N<sub>2</sub>O-producing denitrifier, <i>Pseudomonas</i> <i>chlororaphis</i> (ATCC #43928) to demonstrate that the isotopomer fingerprint of N<sub>2</sub>O derived from denitrification is unique from other that of nitrification.&nbsp; Furthermore, we have demonstrated that in agricultural soils the consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O during denitrification has no affect on site preference.&nbsp; With these results we are now poised to begin to apply isotopomers to apportion the relative contribution of N<sub>2</sub>O derived from nitrification and denitrification in agricultural soils and other environments. &nbsp;"

  abstract: Research into the biophysical mechanisms associated with the formation, function, and stability of soil aggregates is a primary focus of the Soil Biophysics Laboratory. The development of mini-Soil Aggregate Erosion (SEA) chambers provides a unique opportunity for separating soil aggregates into concentric layers. Multiple analyses of each layer are used to determine gradients for a variety of chemical, physical, and biological properties within the aggregates. Quantities and forms of C within soil aggregates are important factors controlling aggregate structure. In addition to the measurement of total C, gradients of <sup>13</sup>C concentrations are being measured. Plants with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways incorporate <sup>13</sup>C at different rates, therefore plants with contrasting metabolism deposit C with differing isotopic ratios into soil components. Consequently, delta <sup>13</sup>C ratios within concentric layers of soil aggregates indicate the recent plant sources of soil C in contrast to C deposition by previous vegetation. Measurements of C gradients in aggregates of the Kalamazoo silt loam from KBS indicate a two- to three-fold increase in the amounts of C within exterior layers of the aggregates compared to the central regions of aggregates. These concentric layer differences are greater in no-till than in conventionally tilled soils. Delta <sup>13</sup>C measurements indicate that up to 67% of the C in the exterior regions of aggregates is derived from recent contemporary plant inputs. Similar measurements are currently being made on aggregates from additional experiments at KBS as well as sites in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Minnesota. Additionally, long-term incubations will be performed to determine the rate of C turn-over from each concentric layer within soil aggregates.

  abstract: The primary purpose of our research is to understand why some farmers implement practices and techniques that are more ecologically beneficial for the environment, whereas other farmers implement practices that are ecologically detrimental for the environment.&nbsp; In order to investigate this research question we need to understand the different ways ecologically beneficial and detrimental are defined within different social segments of agriculture, food, environment and ecology in Michigan.&nbsp; Therefore our research question for the first phase of the research is to understand how different stakeholder groups within agriculture and the environment in Michigan define a farm management practice as either ecologically beneficial or ecologically detrimental.&nbsp; Once we understand the different definitions/language, which stakeholders are using to create their categories of the &#8220;best practices&#8221;, we will be able to create an impact indicator checklist that provides a concordance across the different stakeholder&#8217;s perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine stakeholder groups were identified to represent the range of opinions concerning agriculture and the environment in Michigan.&nbsp; Eleven focus groups were conducted with combinations of representatives from the nine stakeholder groups.&nbsp; The participants perceived that the main areas of impacts were the same for both beneficial and detrimental ecological changes&#8212;air quality, water quality, soil quality, and ecosystem services.&nbsp; Participants within focus groups saw the relationships between practices/techniques and impacts as very complex and contingent on a variety of contextual factors.

  abstract: "With sites in many of North America&rsquo;s major biomes, the LTER Network has much to offer land managers to assist the process of ecosystem management, and indeed, a number of LTER researchers have been involved in ecosystem management. Our objectives in this workshop were to (1) initiate a dialogue on services the LTER Network could provide to ecosystem managers, and (2) explore future needs for LTER involvement in ecosystem management. Thirty-eight people attended the workshop. The group included a number of people with ecosystem management experience, either in an advisory capacity as scientists, as managers or as stakeholders. We began by posing several questions to initiate discussion: (1) How do we make LTER research accessible to managers, (2) How can we be responsive to manager&rsquo;s adaptive management needs, and (3) How do we strengthen communication between managers, stakeholders, and LTER investigators?We identified a number of challenges. Both managers and scientists need to come to terms with the uncertainty of knowledge. We as scientist should transfer concepts rather than technology. A number of institutional barriers, including cultural differences among managers, stakeholders and scientists impede the acceptance of the ecosystem management process. Most of the challenges had to do with communication. We as scientists are not trained to be decision support people. There is a need for communication and better understanding among scientists, managers and stakeholders. We need people trained as science communicators and perhaps should staff people to work the interface of managers and researchers. The decision-making process is important. Decisions are based on values. Our role as scientists is to provide an array of alternatives to decision makers with the risks and the potential outcomes explicit.We also identified opportunities. There is a two-way flow of information in ecosystem management and we learn from the experience of managers and stakeholders. There was substantial interest among workshop participants in another workshop to explore in depth the role of the LTER network and LTER scientists in ecosystem management. The meeting organizers should include managers, stakeholders and researchers. Robertson and Dyer agreed to pursue possibilities for a future workshop."

  abstract: <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>, a deep rooted C4 bunch grass was transplanted to three "old field" successional sites at the Kelog Biological Station.Five years after establishment, samples were taken from the rhizosphere of the Andropogon and the nearby successional community. Sampling was at plant senesence. Six replicates were taken at each of three sites. Nematodes were extracted from soil using the Baerman funnel technique. They were identified to genus, and assigned to life history groups; plant parasite, plant associate, fungal feeder, bacterial feeder, algal feeder, omnivore and carnivore. Several measures of community structure were applied to the resulting data. There were no consistent treatment differences across all three sites. The three sites showed differences in the ratio of Fungivore to bacterivore nematodes, in descending order:Lower Louden, Turkey and McKay. This is consistent with the phospholipid fatty acid marker data from the same samples. At Lower Louden the greatest difference between treatments for fungivore / bacterivore nematode ratio was measured, with the Successional treatment &gt; Andropogon (P&lt;=0.10). There were no significant differences for this measure at the other two locations. There were other site specific differences in nematode community structure by treatment. None were consistent across all sites.

  abstract: The control of pests by their natural enemies represents an important ecosystem service that maintains the stability of agroecosystems and has the potential to mitigate pest control costs both to private producers and to society. Extending the &#8220;economic threshold&#8221; concept, we propose a &#8220;natural enemies-adjusted economic threshold (NEET)&#8221; for pesticide use that takes into account the implicit cost of injury to natural enemies. By explicitly accounting for natural pest suppression, the NEET can potentially make pest management more cost-effective while reducing dependence on toxic insecticides. The threshold is quantified via an intra-seasonal bioeconomic dynamic optimization model of soybean aphid management in Michigan, USA. The results highlight the importance of assessing both pest and natural enemy populations in making insecticide application decisions and accounting for the opportunity cost of insecticide use due to its collateral damage effect on natural enemies. We offer a preliminary, lower bound estimate of the economic value of natural pest suppression to optimal pest control as inferred from the insecticide input replacement cost per acre for the area where the natural enemy complex can suppress pest population below the level at which it causes damage.

  abstract: Impoundments change the characteristics of a water body from a river to a lake, affecting chemical, physical and biological characteristics. Two reservoirs of differing trophic status were sampled weekly in order to quantify the roles of the reservoirs as sinks for nutrients. Lake Allegan is a 1587-acre hypereutrophic impoundment, and is located 43 miles downstream of Morrow Lake, a 1000- acre eutrophic impoundment on the same river. No major tributary inputs exist between the reservoirs. Despite their spatial proximity, in 1999 a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for phosphorus was developed for Lake Allegan to control summer algal blooms, whereas Morrow Pond lacks summer algal blooms.&nbsp; The inflow and outflow waters of Lake Allegan and Morrow Pond were sampled and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus, major solutes and chlorophyll. The biogeochemical changes in river water during passage through the reservoirs will be analyzed, and the two systems will be compared.

  abstract: In general, nutrient enrichments from seedling exudation select for zymogenous microorganisms that colonize the rhizoplane of plant roots grown in soil. However, most microbial ecology studies of the rhizoplane allow living roots to develop in soil for at least 4-5 days before sampling since it is generally though that very young roots are not sufficiently developed to select a microbial community. Indeed, little is known of the very first community of microorganisms that colonize roots grown in soil. The goal of this project is therefore to define the community ecology of the pioneer rhizobacteria that colonize roots of white clover (a nodulated, endomycorrhizal legume) and spring canola (a non-nodulated, non-mycorrhizal brassica) during the first 2 days of germination in a sandy loam soil from an LTER site at KBS. These rhizoplane communities are compared to the pioneer community that colonizes toothpicks (a non-viable woody substratum control) buried in the same soil.Plating experiments on 10% standard plate count/cyclohexamide agar and soil extract/glucose/cyclohexamide agar indicate that the culturable pioneer communities (CFU/mg root dry wt) colonize each of the 3 substrata with similar, initial doubling rates (~ 3 hrs doubling time). However, the duration of exponential growth was 3-5 times longer on the true rhizoplanes, resulting in 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup>-fold higher community densities at 2 days, consistent with their greater resource allocation.Cluster analyses of quantitative cellular FAME data from 626 numerically dominant culturable isolates indicated 600 distinct FAME profiles, only 4% of which clustered. Thus, the pioneer rhizobacterial communities that developed on white clover, canola, and toothpicks were very diverse, contrary to the ecological characteristic that pioneer communities generally have low diversity dominated by just a few species. Further cluster analyses indicated that the structures of each of these pioneer culturable communities were distinct and changed over the 2 day period. A subset of 106 isolates is being analyzed by ARDRA, BIOLOG, and FISH (using group-specific 16SrRNA fluorescent probes) to further assess the diversity, nutritional versatility and phylogeny of these culturable pioneer communities. In addition, T-RFLP analyses are being done on whole rhizoplane communities of clover, canola, and toothpicks sampled at 1 &amp; 2 days. These ongoing tests should further indicate the dynamics and diversity of microbial communities during pioneer colonization of roots, their extent of habitat-selectivity, evidence of ecological succession during pioneer colonization of the rhizoplane, and which bacteria first colonize roots in soil.We also plan to perform computer-assisted microscopy to learn more about the <i>in situ</i> spatial relationships of pioneer rhizobacterial colonization of roots growing in soil. Two major innovative developments have been made to facilitate this work. First, we have developed improved protocols to dislodge soil from roots so that &gt;80% of the rhizoplane can be visualized by scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Second, we have developed new computer-assisted microscopy software, called CMEIAS&copy; (for Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System), tailored to studies of <i>in situ</i> community microbial ecology. These will be used to quantitate the morphological diversity, abundance (numbers, biovolume, biomass C, biosurface area), and spatial relationships (spatial density, % cover, nearest neighbor distribution, and centroid <i>x,y</i> coordinates to compute semivariogram autocorrelation and krieging density maps via GS+ Geostatistics) of the pioneer rhizobacterial communities developing on roots grown in soil. This information will significantly enhance our understanding of the diversity, dynamics and ecological succession of pioneer rhizobacterial communities on a spatial scale relevant to the microorganisms themselves.

  abstract: Predicting the impact that future land management will have on soil C storage requires an understanding of the mechanisms controlling organic matter stabilization.&nbsp; We tested whether the interacting effects of vegetation and soil disturbance on aggregation and organic matter quality could explain soil CO<sub>2</sub>-C loss in eleven cropped and unmanaged ecosystems in Southwest Michigan.&nbsp; The ecosystems represent a management intensity gradient and contain soil C concentrations ranging from 0.69 (conventionally managed corn-soybean-wheat rotation) to 2.58 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (late successional deciduous forest).&nbsp; Large aggregates, which varied from 20-50% of soil weight, responded to changes in tillage intensity as well as vegetation characteristics.&nbsp; The difference in respiration rates of intact versus crushed aggregates was used to infer the effects of physical protection on C turnover.&nbsp; Physical protection of organic matter reduced decomposition rates in all ecosystems and was greatest in an early successional, old-field community.&nbsp; In several mid successional communities with high C concentrations, physical protection of organic matter was equal to that in annual cropping systems and lower than that in the early successional community, indicating the importance of alternative mechanisms that stabilize SOM.&nbsp; We estimated organic matter quality in each ecosystem using the respiration rate of crushed aggregates corrected for the amount of carbon in the sample.&nbsp; Our results show that aggregates confer a modest level of soil C protection that can be altered by tillage and plant community characteristics.

  abstract: "Soils are major anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, and of nitric oxide (NOx), an important component of acid deposition and photochemical smog formation. Greater than 50% of all anthropogenic emissions of N2O are from agricultural soils. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control\x92s National Inventory Guidelines assume that N20 gas fluxes from soils are independent of crop species despite a lack of empirical data to support this assumption. The influence of individual plant species on nitric oxide gas fluxes is largely unknown. It is known, however, that plant species differentially influence the most proximal controls on these gas fluxes (soil O2, NH4+, and NO3- concentrations and carbon availability). Due to their global extent and well characterized biology crop species are good models for studying these effects. By examining soils planted to soybean, corn, and wheat cropped in rotation and continuous cultivation we hope to estimate the N2O and NOx gas fluxes as influenced by the current and previous crop species grown in that soil. Preliminary studies are underway to address these questions."

  abstract: The effects of defoliation on tree physiology are expected to cascade through the entire forest ecosystem, altering carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes, and subsequently affecting nitrogen cycling and plant-herbivore interactions. We examined these phenomena for three years in a hybrid poplar plantation where we regulated defoliation by gypsy moths and nitrogen availability. We expected to see large losses of N from the system following defoliation, due to leaching losses of frass N. Even with intense defoliation, N leaching and soil N pools (inorganic N, microbial N) were unchanged. There was a small increase in ammonium volatilization from defoliated plots (about 1 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> above controls). Although defoliation led to increased levels of leaf phenolics, bioassays showed that decreased gypsy moth caterpillar growth on leaves produced after defoliation was primarily due to lower foliar N. Defoliation decreased tree capacity for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake, although it had little affect on root production and mortality. Defoliation decreased tree growth and increased the rate of top dieback in the stand. Defoliation led to transient declines in allocation to starch. Although N fertilization increased tree growth, it did not alter defoliation effects on starch accumulation or top dieback.

  abstract: A number of recent experimental studies in grasslands have shown that plant diversity can have important effects on a number of community and ecosystem processes.&nbsp; We have recently established an experiment at the KBS LTER in which cropping system diversity is manipulated by varying the number of crops in a row-crop rotation and the use of cover crops.&nbsp; The twenty experimental treatments in the &#8220;Biodiversity Plots Experiment&#8221; were established in 2000 and span a realistic range of crop diversities including no-crop fallows (spring and fall-tilled), single species monocultures (continuous corn, soybean, and winter wheat), two-crop (corn-soybean, wheat-soybean) and three-crop rotations (corn-soybean-wheat), with and without cover crops.&nbsp; All treatments are managed without chemical inputs.&nbsp; We have been monitoring the effects of cropping system diversity on the associate weed communities by sampling the soil seed bank (early May, just after spring crops are planted) and emergent weed community (biomass harvest in late August).&nbsp; Interestingly, cropping system diversity (e.g. the number of crops in the rotation or use of cover crops) had little effect on weed seed densities, emergent weed biomass, species richness, or species evenness. Multivariate analysis of emergent weed community composition among treatments revealed that weed communities in fall fallows and winter wheat treatments are distinct from those in spring-sown crops and fallows.&nbsp; These results suggest that initial differences in weed community composition associated with cropping system diversity are driven by differences in tillage time (fall vs. spring) and that the timing of management activities is initially a more important factor than rotational diversity in determining weed community composition and structure in row-crop systems.

  abstract: "The development of alternative weed management strategies requires a clear understanding of the mechanisms conditioning the establishment, growth and reproduction of invasive plants. This study evaluates the effect of common agricultural practices on weed community dynamics at the KBS LTER site. Specifically, it addresses the following questions: 1) what is the relationship between weed community composition and habitat stability?, 2) do different agricultural practices favor the establishment of certain life-history groups?, 3) is weed community composition determined by the presence of a given crop, the agricultural practice employed or a combination of both factors? Aboveground weed biomass by species was sampled each year (1993-98) at the peak of their occurrence at treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4 using five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat (0.5 m x 2.0 m) in each treatment and block combination. All plants rooted in the quadrat were clipped, separated by species, dried to constant weight, and weighed.More species per sample plot were sampled in treatment 3 and 4 (low chemical inputs) than in treatment 1 and 2 (conventional chemical inputs). A multivariate ordination analysis indicated that chemical input is a main factor conditioning weed community characteristics (<a href=\"Figures/menalled_fig1.htm\">Fig. 1</a>). Spearman correlation coefficients showed that the number and biomass of perennial species were negatively associated with chemical inputs. Evaluation of Euclidean distances among sample sites suggested that year to year variation in weed communities were larger in conventional treatments than in low-input ones. A correlation analysis between site variables such as soil characteristics, crop yield and seed bank composition will be performed to explore mechanisms responsible for weed community variations as a function of agricultural practices."

  abstract: An understanding of current forest productivity provides baseline data to understand the effects of future climate change on productivity.&nbsp; Tree productivity studies generally include destructively measuring tree components or use allometric equations established by destructive sampling.&nbsp; However, destructive sampling in long-term forested plots is not feasible.&nbsp; In any case, no standard methods have been consistently applied to estimate forest productivity in the published literature or across the LTER system.&nbsp; The purpose of this project is to develop an efficient and non-destructive set of techniques to estimate recent aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in forested landscapes.&nbsp; Litterfall production was measured over 8 years using one or more litter traps in all 3 Deciduous Forest (DF) replicates at Kellogg Biological Station in southwest Michigan.&nbsp; Recent (10yr) aboveground wood production was measured as biomass increment as calculated from current diameter and xylem increments using established regional biomass equations for each tree within the 2400m<sup>2</sup> plot in DF3.&nbsp; Average (8yr) litterfall production was 491 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, and average (10yr) aboveground wood production was 364 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr for a total of 855 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr of aboveground net primary productivity.&nbsp; These proposed methods can be easily applied to forests with trees expressing annual growth rings and having established allometric equations.&nbsp; Further study will assess the utility and viability of proposing these methods as LTER protocol.

  abstract: Soil harbors approximately 10^9-10^10 bacterial cells per gram of soil, however only about 1% of these cells have been cultured at this time. Without pure cultures it is difficult to assess the physiological potential and impact these microorganisms have in the soil environment. The creation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library is a molecular method used to capture genomic DNA in microbially diverse environments. The genomic content of organisms in environmental samples can be analyzed which yields new insight into their in situ metabolic capabilities. BAC vectors can accommodate large pieces (100-500 kb) of DNA, but until now, there has not been a way to preferentially capture phylogenetically useful information (i.e., rRNA gene sequences) linked to genes indicating an organisms physiological potential. A unique BAC vector, pSuperPhyloBAC, has been constructed that contains an I-CeuI restriction site. I-CeuI is an intron-encoded endonuclease that cuts within the 23S rRNA gene of most bacteria. A cloning strategy has been developed that would allow genomic DNA that has been cut with I-CeuI to be inserted into pSuperPhyloBAC. Due to the high degree of conservation in bacterial rRNA operons, this will allow for the creation of a unique BAC library in which each clone would contain a partial 23S rRNA gene and a complete 16S rRNA gene. This library will allow for rapid screening of clones to isolate those containing DNA from microbial groups of interest along with genes indicating their physiological potential. This library will allow us to begin to bridge the gap between phylogeny and function in an environment with few members in pure culture.

  abstract: Biogeochemical processes in agricultural ecosystems regulate nutrient availability and thereby have a major impact on crop production, and also control nutrient exports via gas emissions and solution leaching or run-off. Thus, studying biogeochemistry in agricultural ecosystems can provide substantial economic as well as environmental benefits. As importantly, agricultural ecosystems also provide an exceptional setting in which to examine the mechanisms and controls on biogeochemical processes in general, and thus to contribute to a fundamental understanding of ecosystems. We will present two examples of fundamental information about nutrient cycling processes that have benefited from studies in agroecosystems. In the first example, we will discuss new information from studies of irrigated wheat systems on the regulation of nitrification vs. denitrification as sources of important trace gases. In the second example, we will illustrate how studies of soil microbial diversity in row crop systems are contributing to our general understanding of the relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem function. In these and other areas, biogeochemical studies in agricultural ecosystems are providing significant contributions to ecological theory.

  abstract: "<span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line\">Concern over the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has focused research efforts on determining the quality and quantity of C that can be stored as soil organic-C (SOC) and the degree to which this storage can be used to mitigate industrial pollution. Sequestration of C in soils can be improved greatly by changes in current agricultural practices.&nbsp; Determining the quantity of C that can be stored as a result is critical for governmental policy decisions. Understanding SOC dynamics requires knowledge of the size and fluxes of the SOC pools involved. Modeling has shown that first order kinetics and a three-pool concept can describe SOC dynamics effectively.&nbsp; Carbon sequestration was determined for seven different agricultural systems at the Kellogg Biological Station, MI following ten years of management. SOC dynamics were evaluated using long term incubations to determine pool sizes for C including the active C pool (Ca), slow C pool (Cs) and resistant C pool (Cr).&nbsp; Active fraction pool size and turnover rate differed among conventional till agriculture, perennial poplars and successional communities. Slow fraction pool turnover rate differed among conventional till agriculture, no till management, organic based low input systems and never tilled successional treatments.

  abstract: Nitrate disappearance in sediments is usually assumed to be due to respiratory denitrification, an important process for improving water quality.  While performing tracer experiments in aquatic sediments of Michigan, we found that nitrate removal coincided with sulfate production, and that sulfate removal commenced only after nitrate was depleted.  Because this activity appears to be biological, we hypothesize that the nitrate removal is due to sulfur oxidizing bacteria that use nitrate as an oxidant in the production sulfate.  Sulfur oxidizers do not necessarily denitrify nitrate to dinitrogen, but may instead produce ammonium via a form of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA).  Push-pull experiments in streams, lakes and wetlands (23 sites) revealed a persistent pattern of sulfate production during nitrate removal.  The nitrate introduction also yielded significant ammonium production and sulfide removal compared to controls (bromide introduction only).  The sulfur-oxidizing pathway of nitrate removal has important implications for water quality by coupling nitrate removal to sulfur cycling.  If this is a form of DNRA, nitrate removed via this pathway would remain in a biologically available form, in contrast to respiratory denitrification.

  abstract: "&nbsp;The increasing concentration of nitrous oxide in Earth's atmosphere contributes to radiative forcing of climate change and to the catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone. Understanding the nitrous oxide budget requires understanding the relative proportions of nitrous oxide and dinitrogen produced during denitrification, which is the major source of nitrous oxide in terrestrial environments. Characterization of the N2O:N2 flux ratio requires highly precise simultaneous flux estimates for both gases. We have developed a method that estimates both fluxes independently from the shift in isotopic character of gases in confined atmospheres above labeled soil. This method has been developed to estimate N2 flux, which is difficult to measure by other means. We extend the method to estimate flux of N2O. Very small fluxes can be measured since isotopic analysis of nitrous oxide can be performed reliably on less than 0.2 micrograms of N as N2O. Using the same method for both N2 and N2O improves the reliability of the flux ratio estimate.Results from a field study in April and May of 1998 illustrate the application of the technique. Incubations were conducted before and after natural precipitation, using a soil cover over labeled soil. Headspace samples were collected at the beginning and end of each incubation. Figure 1 illustrates the isotopic character of N2O for each sample; soil N enrichment and N2O flux can be infered graphically or mathematically. N2 analysis is similar. Figure 2 summarizes gas fluxes during the period of study. Flux estimates of N2O by mass spectrometry agree well with results from gas chromatography. Estimates for N2 are near the detection limit for this experimental configuration.Figure 1. Isotopic character of initial and final N2O for 9 field incubations.Figure 2.

  abstract: Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub>. Efforts to mitigate the atmosphere's growing global warming potential (GWP) requires knowledge about all three gas fluxes under a variety of management strategies, as well as knowledge about historical fluxes from unmanaged systems. Over an 8 - 10 year period we measured soil C and N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in a replicated series of 4 annual cropping systems, 2 perennial cropping systems, and 4 types of unmanaged communities with different successional histories. Soil carbon accumulated in the no-till and organic-based cropping systems (0.03 and 0.01 kg C /m<sup>2</sup>/y, respectively), as well as under perennial crops and successional vegetation. Overall fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> did not differ among annual cropping systems (ca. 3.8 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N /ha/d and -1.8 g CH<sub>4</sub>-C /ha/d), but N<sub>2</sub>O production was substantially lower and methane oxidation substantially higher in the unmanaged systems, with average fluxes of -9.4 g CH<sub>4</sub>-C /ha/d and 1.2 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N /ha/d in the late successional sites. GWP analysis shows that in no-till systems the mitigation potential of soil C sequestration (-110 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y) was halved by the GWP of N<sub>2</sub>O flux (64 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y), and halved again by the GWP of N-fertilizer use (27g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y). In the low-input and organic systems, C sequestration mitigation potentials (-29 to -40 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y) were completely offset by the GWP of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (58-69 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y). CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation contributed little to the mitigation of GWP in any of the cropped or early successional systems. High total mitigation potentials of the perennial crops (ca. 110 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y) and the early successional systems (-211 g CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents /m<sup>2</sup>/y) were due in part to relatively low N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. The development of mitigation strategies based on ecosystem management need to include considerations of changes in N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in addition to changes in C storage.

  abstract: Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, agricultural fertilizer application and legume cultivation are adding large amounts of fixed nitrogen to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.   This added nitrogen causes a number of serious environmental problems such as acidification of soil and water, harmful algal blooms, and impairment of drinking water supplies.  Despite the importance of these problems, we have a poor understanding of the fate of this added nitrogen.  Studies of large river basins show that most of the added nitrogen is not exported to the oceans but has disappeared from our accounting somewhere within these basins.   Recent research has indicated that uptake and removal by plants and microbes in streams and rivers might account for some of the missing nitrogen.  In particular, it appears that small streams in the headwaters of river basins are most important in removing nitrogen.  To gain a better understanding of the role that small streams play in removing nitrogen from water and preventing it from polluting downstream ecosystems, experiments are being performed in 72 streams in eight different regions of the United States.  To determine how humans affect the ability of streams to take up and remove nitrogen, streams in agricultural and urban areas as well as in more undeveloped watersheds are included in the study.  A naturally occurring but uncommon isotope of nitrogen (15N) is added to stream water as nitrate (the most abundant form of fixed nitrogen in streams) over a 24-hour period.  The fate of the added 15N is tracked by collecting samples of water and different forms of stream organic matter downstream from the addition point.  The experimental results are then used to develop a general model of nitrogen retention in streams that includes uptake by organisms and permanent removal by the production of nitrogen gas.  These results are extended to much larger spatial scales by combining our stream model with information on nitrogen loading and land use in one large river basin in each of the eight study regions to predict nitrogen concentrations at the river mouth. These predictions are tested by field measurements of stream nitrogen concentrations at different locations within each river basin.  The ultimate goal of the research is to provide land managers and planners with a better understanding of the importance of streams in controlling the nitrogen loading to lakes and coastal ecosystems, and to show how humans can preserve or enhance these ecosystem services provided by streams.

  abstract: A thorough analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of crop productivity in an eco-regional context at various hierarchical levels may reveal the ecologically based structure of an agricultural production system. This would facilitate the development of ecologically based management systems for agriculture. Our long-term goal will be to assess the long-term viability of agricultural systems at a regional scale by reducing the impact of agricultural practices on natural systems. We expect that this analysis will set the stage to begin the development of a model to forecast regional crop productivity in the next century. This model would integrate physical, ecological, socio-economic, and management systems.Our first step will be to evaluate the spatial scale at which the physical system (climate and geomorphology) influence or determine crop productivity patterns in the North Central Region. Crop yield characterization will be conducted at different spatial scales over a period of 20 years. We will then assess the effect of climatic fluctuations on crop yield at each scale within an eco-regional hierarchy. In addition we will assess which regional scheme and which scale best explains patterns of crop yield in the North Central Region. Using analytical spatial technologies, we will generate spatial gradients of crop yields that will be compared against the different scales of ecoregion classification schemes. Major outcomes of this project will be a) the development of procedures and protocols for an ecoregion-based geospatial analysis of agricultural system performance, b) a scale analysis of crop productivity in the Corn Belt over a 25 year period, under agrobased and ecobased regions and c) an assessment of how ecobased regions can facilitate the development of ecologically based agricultural systems in the Corn Belt.Return to Contents

  abstract: We are currently in the initial stage of investigating the ways that social factors and biophysical environmental factors interact in agricultural pest systems - in this case, that of the Western Corn Rootworm (WCR).&nbsp; For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that two-or three-year corn-soybean (or corn-soy-wheat) rotations act as a low-input, non-resistance inducing, means of holding western corn rootworm populations below economic damage thresholds.&nbsp; Recently, western corn rootworm "behavioral variants" have been found in areas near the Illinois-Indiana border and in isolated areas in Michigan and Ohio.&nbsp; These "rotation resistant" WCR appear to have adapted to rotations and now often lays eggs in fields planted with soybeans, which leads to WCR populations in first-year corn near, at or above economic thresholds.&nbsp;Our research follows on published and unpublished research by O'Neal, et al. (2002) - including feeding assays and field studies - that suggest the WCR variant's behavior may be derived less from the development of a new genotype (though this may be true as well) and more from the expression of already-present, but heretofore unnecessary, behavioral plasticity induced by new and unevenly distributed agroecological conditions.&nbsp; Recent movement towards earlier planting dates and more cold-hardy varieties may have disrupted what was, in the past, a synchronicity between corn phenology and WCR development.&nbsp; Following on O'Neal et al., our hypothesis is that the emergence of the WCR behavioral variant is largely caused by regional changes in cultivation practices - early planting and/or planting of new cold-hardy varieties - which have altered the relationship between corn phenology and WCR development.&nbsp; A second-order hypothesis is that the unevenness of the distribution of the variant is associated with the distribution of rotational and crop-mixture diversity.&nbsp; For example, in the IL/IN border region corn-soy rotations and few other crops increase the likelihood that beetles leaving corn will oviposit in soy.&nbsp; In MI or OH, greater cropping diversity and/or three-crop rotations may reduce the likelihood that gravid WCR beetles will find soy upon leaving phonologically-unattractive corn.The purpose of our study is to identify whether or not cultural practices and corn variety selection have changed in the spatial and temporal manner coincident with the arrival of WCR "behavioral variants" and our hypotheses, above.&nbsp; In the next year we will conduct interviews with extension agents, farmers, and seed company representatives to examine these agroecological changes as they have developed over the past 20 years.&nbsp; These interviews will focus on crop rotations, pesticide applications, and crops planted.&nbsp; We will then compare temporal changes in these farming practices to the emergence of WCR behavioral variants in specific areas of the Midwest.&nbsp; <a href="Figures/rudy_1.jpg">Figure 1.</a>

  abstract: Although a large carbon sink was found to be related to the enhanced growth in the North America using satellite observations, the global carbon budget is still unbalanced. In search for additional carbon sinks or sources, attention is now turned to the roles of land use and land cover changes. Previous studies suggest that by managing agricultural lands appropriately substantial carbon can also be stored in no-till farmlands. Should know exactly the total areas of no-till managed agricultural lands, total amount of carbon sequestrated by no-till agricultural lands can be estimated. However, to what magnitude is the no-till management being practiced in Michigan and in the entire US is still unclear. In this study, we extend the previous studies on carbon sequestration by quantifying the total amount of no-till agricultural lands using satellite remote sensing images. Satellite images were acquired in the early Spring 2002 and no-till agricultural lands being classed with intensive ground survey data. The results showed that we could estimate the total amount of no-till agricultural lands at a 90% accuracy, allowing quantitative estimates of the carbon sequestration over large areas.

  abstract: Soil harbors approximately 10^9-10^10 bacterial cells per gram of soil, however only about 1% of these cells have been cultured at this time. Without pure cultures it is difficult to assess the physiological potential and impact these microorganisms have in the soil environment. The creation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library is a molecular method used to capture genomic DNA in microbially diverse environments. The genomic content of organisms in environmental samples can be analyzed which yields new insight into their in situ metabolic capabilities. BAC vectors can accommodate large pieces (100-500 kb) of DNA, but until now, there has not been a way to preferentially capture phylogenetically useful information (i.e., rRNA gene sequences) linked to genes indicating an organisms physiological potential. A unique BAC vector, pSuperPhyloBAC, has been constructed that contains an I-CeuI restriction site. I-CeuI is an intron-encoded endonuclease that cuts within the 23S rRNA gene of most bacteria. A cloning strategy has been developed that would allow genomic DNA that has been cut with I-CeuI to be inserted into pSuperPhyloBAC. Due to the high degree of conservation in bacterial rRNA operons, this will allow for the creation of a unique BAC library in which each clone would contain a partial 23S rRNA gene and a complete 16S rRNA gene. This library will allow for rapid screening of clones to isolate those containing DNA from microbial groups of interest along with genes indicating their physiological potential. This library will allow us to begin to bridge the gap between phylogeny and function in an environment with few members in pure culture.

  abstract: We surveyed soil microbial communities in several successional old fields in southwestern Michigan to assess "soil" and "plant" effects on community structure. Six replicate early successional plots of the same soil fertility and agronomic history were compared to four late successional fields of different fertility and history. In order to more closely examine soil and plant effects on the microbial community, we sampled under the same plant species, Andropogon gerardii, as well as under the mixed plant community in the four late successional fields. Wecharacterized the soil communities with microbial biomass C, plate counts, N-mineralization rates, patterns of substrate utilization (BIOLOG) and marker fatty acids (PLFA) at peak plant biomass (August) and plant senescence (October). Preliminary results indicate that microbialcommunities in the early successional plots had differing BIOLOG and PLFA patterns than those in the late succession fields, possibly due to differences in soil fertility or agronomic history. In the four late successional fields, maximum potential N mineralization and substrateutilization differed between the communities under A. gerardii and those under the mixed plant community. These differences may be due to direct effects of plant roots or indirect effects of plants on soil moisture or other resources. Results from this study suggest that soil history, and possibly fertility, may drive differences in microbial communities. The difference in microbial functional response to an individual plant species, A. gerardii, also indicates that the composition of the plant community may be important. Further exploration of microbial community structure should include examination of both site history and the overlying plant community.Return to Contents

  abstract: Biogeochemical transformations in wetlands impact water quality and nutrient transport across landscapes as well as greenhouse gas fluxes.&nbsp; We explored the influence of anaerobic microbial respiration on wetland biogeochemistry in surficial sediments of six southwest Michigan wetlands in a glacial terrain, three of which were mainly groundwater-fed and three were mainly precipitation-fed. Water source for each site was verified from major solute composition.&nbsp; We measured ambient rates of denitrification, sulfate reduction, iron reduction, methanogenesis and acetate turnover, and performed in-situ push-pull experiments using local groundwater amended with bromide.&nbsp; Nitrate concentrations in porewaters were low at all sites, even though groundwater inputs are often elevated in nitrate.&nbsp; Despite the lack of actual denitrification, all six wetlands showed potential to rapidly remove nitrate, as indicated by denitrifying enzyme activity and in-site push-pull experiments.&nbsp; Iron (II) concentrations varied among the sites, but iron reduction was measurable mainly in precipitation-fed wetlands.&nbsp; Sulfate reduction rates were greater in groundwater-fed wetlands than precipitation-fed wetlands, resulting in removal of sulfate and some accumulation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfate was taken up from injected groundwater only after nitrate was depleted.&nbsp; Methanogenesis was measurable in all wetlands, with no differences between wetlands with contrasting water sources, indicating that methanogenesis is important regardless of water source.

  abstract: Along with cattle, sheep and horses, swine have been one of the four main types of livestock in Michigan from 1854 to 1997. Although swine have never been the dominant component of livestock in southwestern Michigan, they have generally been the second most common. After 1954, the number of pigs grew sharply, then dropped dramatically between 1904 and 1940. This was likely due at least in part to the great Depression, and possibly was affected by the reform of the meat packing industry after 1904. After 1940, however, hogs have been growing steadily, and are now at about the same number that they were in 1884. Initially hogs were allowed to run freely in the wooded areas of the early farms, grazing on roots, nuts and mast in the forested areas of the farm.  Permanent pig pens led to disease problems, and were replaced by movable pens. Contemporary facilities are entirely enclosed, have some degree of biosafety, and attempt to minimize the incidence of diseases. Over all these changes, the enduring constant has been the manure from the hogs.  When the hogs ran freely, manure was also deposited wherever the animal happened to be. With the development of confinement systems, manure had to be transported from the pig pens to the fields for incorporation into the soil. Although manure from confinement operations is stored and composted, environmental threats from volatization and runoff still remain. At the same time, the pressure on rural land for residential purposes creates conditions where farms and even entire counties have more manure than can be spread safely on the available farmland. In these conditions, hog farmers have to make deals with other landowners to obtain access to additional land for manure disposal. This still leaves the possibility that the phosphorus in the manure will exceed the absorptive capacity of the land, and that the excess phosphorus will be carried in percolation and runoff to surface and ground waters.

Our past work on the KBS LTER has focused on documenting patterns of plant diversity (species composition and abundance) in the various treatments on the main experimental site. We plan to expand the scope of this work to examine directly the temporal and spatial patterns and consequences of plant diversity in the agronomic treatments, successional and more established communities in the region. These communities represent a broad range of ANPP and a variety of disturbance types and can be used to examine our hypotheses about the linkages between disturance (management), productivity, consumer-microbial diversity and ecosystem function. We plan work in four major areas: 1) the importance of seed banks as reservoirs of plant diversity, 2) the relationship between productivity and diversity in successional communities, 3) scales and patterns of diversity among managed and unmanaged communities, and 4) the consequences of plant diversity in row crop rotations.

  abstract: Culture independent clone libraries of the gene encoding nitrite reductase (nirK) were previously used to characterize the community structure of denitrifiers in different soil treatments at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research Site (KBS-LTER Site). The community structure of denitrifiers, represented by recovered <i>nirK</i> sequences, appeared more diverse (both richer and more even) in conventional agricultural soil (represented by Treatment 1) versus <i>nirK</i> community structures in mid-successional soils (Treatments 7 and 8). To investigate the influence of soil composition (specifically soil aggregate size distribution in different soil treatments) on denitrifier populations, blocks of soil from Treatments 1, 7, and 8 were collected and processed. Based on similar soil aggregate size distributions in Treatments 7 and 8, <i>nirK</i> libraries were constructed from three different soil aggregate size classes from Treatment 8. Sequences recovered from these libraries were aligned with <i>nirK</i> sequences recovered from unfractionated bulk soil. A large portion of recovered sequences from each of the three aggregate libraries grouped within one large phylogenetic cluster that contained almost no sequences from conventional agricultural soil (T1). We hypothesize that the organisms represented by this cluster are responsible for the rapid and complete reduction of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) to dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) in mid-successional soils at the KBS-LTER Site.

  abstract: Theoretical models and experiments suggesting that populations are less stable in diverse communities have formed much of our current understanding of biodiversity-stability relationships. However, simplifications of natural communities may exclude potentially important features of complex ecosystems which may also affect population stability. By incorporating natural complexities, investigations of biodiversity-stability relationships in self-assembled communities can lead to insights regarding the relative importance of biodiversity and can help put theory and experimental findings into context. We examined the relationship between population stability and species richness in successional fields at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research site over a twelve year period. Contrary to most prior research, populations appear to be more stable at higher species densities; however, accounting for temporal trends in species richness and stability generates an alternative interpretation. Our analyses suggest that species density dampens the positive temporal trend in stability, supporting previous theoretical and experimental findings that diversity has a negative effect on population stability. In this system, regional and life history characteristics associated with successional patterns appear to have a stronger influence on population stability than does biodiversity.

  abstract: Changes in nitrifier and denitrifier populations following intense soil disturbance may control inorganic soil N availability and alter trace gas fluxes. Long-term studies have demonstrated changes in these organisms and their function following long-term cultivation but the immediate and short-term effects of cultivation remain largely unknown. Our objectives are to investigate changes in nitrifier and denitrifier enzyme dynamics and their relationship to patterns of nitrous oxide flux and soil inorganic N concentrations. Additionally, we examine microbial functional diversity and species composition of cultivated and uncultivated soils.

  abstract: Weed management strategies for organic producers are generally limited to crop rotations, cover or companion crops, and mechanical cultivation. Experimental evidence suggests that longer crop rotations with diverse crops can reduce seedbank populations of important weed species in organic production systems. Prediction of weed seedling densities from buried seed reserves has been improved by considering specific sampling size, date, number and technique. For example, some investigators have found the greenhouse germination assay to be more reliable with a smaller sample size taken in early spring than seed extraction by elutriation when correlating field seedling densities. Germination techniques as predictive tools have been supported as more accurate methods of seedling density estimation. With a modified sampling technique designed to capture spatial variability by increasing number of soil cores of a reduced core diameter, others have shown enhanced predictability of weed seedling densities using a greenhouse germination assay. A four-year rotation of alfalfa, corn, soybean and wheat produced with organic sources of nutrients (manure and crop residue), and no synthetic chemical inputs may increase soil organic matter quality and decrease the weed seed bank as compared to one year of conventionally grown corn followed by three years of continuous alfalfa for the transition to a certified organic system. This hypothesis was tested throughout the 2005 growing season. Results of the greenhouse assay and field density estimations are incorporated into this poster presentation.

  abstract: "Plant root systems are often said to be efficient integrators of soil resource heterogeneity within their reach; however, this view may be too simplistic if processes controlling resource supply rate are altered by spatial heterogeneity.&nbsp; The spatial aggregation of labile organic matter in soil has potential to influence several interacting ecosystem processes including decomposition, nutrient mineralization, plant nutrient acquisition, and primary productivity.&nbsp; To investigate the effects of soil resource aggregation on C and N cycling, we experimentally manipulated the spatial distribution <i>Trifolium pretense</i> litter in soil into aggregation gradients.&nbsp; Our initial experiment followed seedling growth response of seven herbaceous plant species to an aggregation gradient with five levels: 2, 8, 32, and 128 patches or uniformly.&nbsp; The litter aggregation gradient influenced the aboveground growth of the two species with the greatest absolute growth rates.&nbsp; We also monitored the decomposition rate of the litter along this gradient in the absence of seedlings, and found that aggregating litter into a few large patches delayed the maximum decomposition rate by six days relative to the uniform distribution.&nbsp; We designed a subsequent field experiment to test the hypothesis that the synchrony between litter N mineralization rate and plant N uptake plays an important role in plant growth responses to soil resource spatial aggregation.&nbsp; We measured N mineralization and plant N uptake in response to 60g of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled <i>Trifolium pretense</i> litter (21 g of N kg<sup>-1</sup>) distributed into 8 or 32 patches or uniformly surrounding individual <i>Zea mays</i> plants.&nbsp; Aboveground biomass was 14% greater (p&lt;0.02) in response to aggregated litter than to uniformly distributed litter.&nbsp; Soil inorganic N varied across the aggregation gradient early in the growing season with the highest concentration in the most aggregated, intermediate with intermediate aggregation, and the lowest soil inorganic N concentration from uniformly distributed litter. &nbsp;<sup>15</sup>N budgeting methodologies help to interpret these results.&nbsp; Nutrient supply rates in soils at the scale of individual plants are naturally heterogeneous.

  abstract: "To implement a functional cyberinfrastructure we have examined a suite of ecological variables that capture important ecological phenomena. The five fundamental human senses are communication, feel, touch, taste smell and vision.&nbsp; Automated sensors are developed for several of these senses. They include: Communication (acoustic sensors); Feel (meteorological sensors); Taste and Smell (chemical sensors); and Vision (optical sensors). Humans and other organisms require these senses for survival.Given this array of potential senses and associated potential sensor technology, we choose to enable our sensor cyberinfrastructure design based on the communication sense. The ability to hear and to interpret sound is one of our basic senses. Acoustic signals produced by the environment are an untapped resource to assess the dynamics and health of the Earth?s ecosystems within which we live and extract resources. We argue that acoustic sensors are equally useful for monitor ecological communication and for sensing human activities leading to ecological change.A sensor system comprised of a sensor platform, an associated local server and a web services system to manage the platform has been developed at MSU (Gage and Biswas 2005). The sensor platform is based on the Crossbow Stargate processor. Our implementation of this Linux OS processor includes the incorporation of multiple sensor types including meteorological, image, and acoustics. The relatively low-cost sensor system enables deployment of multiple sensor platforms in the landscape.&nbsp; The heart of sensor system is a web-services interface residing on each platform with a wireless communications interface to each platform from a local server. The common web service is resident on each sensor platform and communication is enabled based on the ID of the platform. The server can handle multiple platforms within communication range, enhanced by a high-end wireless antenna.Back to Poster Titles"

  abstract: The degree to which the composition of a weed community is predictable from season to season may have implications for growers interested in developing more efficient weed management strategies.&nbsp; Identification of agricultural management practices that affect the predictability of the weed community may, therefore, be an important component of a sustainable weed management program that decreases the costs and lessens the human health and environmental impacts associated with off-farm chemical inputs.&nbsp; Both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that complex ecological systems are more stable than simple systems. Management practices that increase the complexity of the cropping system, such as organic-based management or crop rotation, may result in weed communities that are more stable, and hence more predictable.&nbsp; We investigated the stability of the emergent weed community, measured as constancy in richness and community composition over a four-year period, in a long-term annual row-crop experiment manipulating inputs (conventional versus organic) and crop rotation (continuous corn versus a four-year rotation).&nbsp; Emergent weed community richness and composition varied among treatments and years. Community composition over the four-year study period was more stable in continuous corn than the corn rotation.  Input system did not affect stability.

  abstract: Simulation of physical and biological phenomena at multiple time and space scales is playing a pivotal role in areas that range from genetic studies to global change analysis and assessment. Regional simulation models require the use of large data inputs and are evolving in scope and sophistication. A Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework (MASIF) is presented as a method to facilitate utilization of large amounts of spatial-temporal outputs from regional scale simulations. MASIF incorporates commercial software that provide the model analyst with the ability to rapidly summarize and analyze model results. MASIF enables visualization of model input data, model simulation results, and computation of statistical patterns of information associated with model inputs and outputs. In developing MASIF we have adopted a modular approach that allows the coupling of a model to the analysis and mapping framework using either executable model code or raw computer instructions, and the parameters files. We are currently enabling MASIF to accommodate satellite remotely sensing data as a driver to calibrate model predictions during simulation. For example, we use remote sensing information to adjust simulated biomass or LAI output from daily crop growth. &nbsp;The MASIF environment provides a powerful and flexible environment that allows model analysts to conduct creative regional experiments with either complex or simple regional models. By providing models with a robust user interface, modelers can optimize their efforts and concentrate on model development. We recognize the value of stand-alone and network-based analytical environments for model assessment and application and thus envision the potential to run, analyze, and visualize web-based simulation models.

Agricultural sites consist of two alfalfa plots, and two poplar plots. Forested sites are composed of three coniferous (CF-1, 2, 3), three deciduous (DF-1, 2, 3), and three succession forest plots (SF-1, 2, 3). Recording: Two programmable tape recorders were set in each location and were timed to record in the morning at: 0000, 0530, 0630, 0730, 0830, and 1100 hrs. and during the afternoon at 1430 1600 1830 1930 2030, and 2130 hrs. Recording duration was 3 minutes at each recording time resulting in 12 recordings each day. Environmental acoustic signals were recorded for three days every two weeks from May 18 to July 15, 2005. The recordings were digitized and transferred to a wav file containing a 22 kHz frequency sampling rate and a monaural channel for quantification and analysis of the acoustic signals. Each 3 minute recording was subsequently divided into 30 second acoustic samples for analysis. Three methods were used to analyze the acoustic samples. First the power of the acoustic signal was determined for each of eleven 1 kHz frequency levels. These were partitioned into two main categories based on frequency position. Technophony = 0-2 kHz and Biophony = 3-8 kHz. This analysis was run for each of approximately 1500 30-second samples. These values were summarized for each of the sites samples. Second, Principle Component Analysis was used 1) to partition the sites, 2) the strength of the biophony in each site, and 3) to assess the temporal dynamics of biophony across all sites. Third, each recording made at each site was reviewed and avian signals were identified to species. Species occurrence and number of calls made by each species in each site were compiled. Species diversity was determined using the Shannon-Wiener method.Back to Poster Titles"

  abstract: "Abstract: Hydrologic nitrogen losses from managed ecosystems affect plant nitrogen availability and cause ground and coastal water eutrophication and drinking water contamination: greater than 10% of the domestic drinking-water wells in the Midwest contain unsafe levels of nitrates. We tested the impact of management intensity on the level of nitrogen loss through nitrate leaching. Quartz soil water samplers were used to sample leachate from four annual cropping systems (corn-soybean-wheat rotations managed as conventional, no-till, low-input, and organic systems), two perennial cropping systems (alfalfa and poplar trees), two successional systems (early and mid-successional old fields), and two forest systems (planted conifer and native deciduous systems) all replicated on the same soil series. Samples were collected twice a month from March 1995-November 2005, and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen. Nitrate leaching was highest in annual agricultural plots and perennial alfalfa plots. Successional plots and plots with trees (fast growing poplar clones) showed the lowest leaching levels, while native forested sites showed intermediate levels of nitrate levels. Within agricultural systems, conventional tilled and no-tilled systems showed higher leaching losses than organic systems. These results suggest the potential to reduce nitrate leaching in agricultural systems through greater investments in nitrogen management and reducing nitrogen applications to crops. Results also suggest the potential for large nitrogen losses from forage crops where no inorganic nitrogen is being applied. Additionally, these results may be useful in predicting the impact of land use change on water quality."

  abstract: "Soils are major anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, and of nitric oxide (NOx), an important component of acid deposition and photochemical smog formation. Greater than 50% of all anthropogenic emissions of N2O are from agricultural soils. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control\x92s National Inventory Guidelines assume that N20 gas fluxes from soils are independent of crop species despite a lack of empirical data to support this assumption. The influence of individual plant species on nitric oxide gas fluxes is largely unknown. It is known, however, that plant species differentially influence the most proximal controls on these gas fluxes (soil O2, NH4+, and NO3- concentrations and carbon availability). Due to their global extent and well characterized biology crop species are good models for studying these effects. By examining soils planted to soybean, corn, and wheat cropped in rotation and continuous cultivation we hope to estimate the N2O and NOx gas fluxes as influenced by the current and previous crop species grown in that soil. Preliminary studies are underway to address these questions."

To facilitate this objective we developed a Modeling Applications System Integrative Framework (MASIF) which links an array of existing visualization, analytical, and data management software to manage model inputs and outputs as well as model execution. We are conducting three projects that demonstrate applications of MASIF. In the first project we want to characterize and analyze crop productivity in the North Central Region and explore future scenarios via modeling. We have conducted an analysis and comparison of historical observational data with outputs from crop simulation models. In the second project a crop model was calibrated to the cooler climate of the Upper Great Lakes Region. We tested the effects of temperature modifications and related that to the performance of the model. In the third project we have incorporated the DAYCENT model with MASIF to simulate regional sinks and sources of greenhouse gasses from agricultural soils including croplands and grasslands. We anticipate that simulations will provide information to decision makers for the assessment of economic, environmental and biophysical impacts of mitigation practices and policies.

  abstract: The sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils now depleted in organic matter is a well-known strategy for mitigating the build up of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Full-cost accounting of the effects of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to quantify the relative contributions of all agricultural inputs and operations in determining net carbon sequestration. Such an analysis includes CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions associated with nitrogen fertilizer production and application, agricultural liming, pesticides and fuel use. By evaluating all sources in terms of their global warming potential (GWP) policy makers are provided with the best available information for developing cost-effective, potentially large scale options for greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture systems.Soil carbon storage is heavily dependent on the soil type, climate and the quantity and quality of organic material returned to the soil. The magnitude of carbon sequestration in response to management interventions is therefore site specific. Targeting of strategies promoting sequestration to highly responsive locations will ensure maximum returns. Identification of these locations across a region is possible through the use of simulations models which mimic terrestrial carbon dynamics in both space and time.Modeling at regional scales is complex, and thus has only been attempted by research groups with the necessary synergy of biology, modeling and computer science skills. A Modeling Applications Integrative Framework (MASIF) was specifically developed to process the large amounts of spatial-temporal data necessary for regional scale simulation experiments. We have incorporated a simple, but proven terrestrial carbon dynamics model to MASIF to assess the impact of tillage options on carbon storage in agricultural soils of the North Central Region (NCR) over the next century.Back to Poster Titles

  abstract: Improving our understanding of the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities is essential to understanding microbial contributions to ecosystem functioning. Of particular interest is the soil basidiomycete community as they play an important role in nutrient cycling. This role is especially significant in the agriculture and forestry sectors where nutrient supply and turnover is a limiting factor to long term primary productivity. The filamentous growth form of basidiomycetes and their copious production of extracellular mucopolysaccharides might also have related benefits to soil stabilization and carbon storage. Advancements in molecular techniques and DNA extraction methods from soils are allowing researchers to explore soil microbial communities at much greater taxonomic resolution than direct microscopy methods and without the biases associated with traditional culture-based sampling approaches. We used molecular techniques to study the basidiomycete community within four agriculturally-related treatments at KBS-LTER. Soil extracted DNA was amplified with basidiomycete-specific primers and the resulting mixed template was cloned. Plasmids were extracted from selected clones and digested using restriction enzymes. Plasmids yielding unique digest patterns were sequenced and placed within a phylogenetic tree for nearest-neighbour identification. Ninety-eight unique sequences were obtained from 320 clones, with representatives from five of the eight clades of homobasidiomycetes described by Hibbett and Thorn (2001). The majority of the sequences (69% of all clones) belong to the euagarics clade. Preliminary analyses indicate that the overall diversity of homobasidiomycetes followed similar patterns to earlier studies by Lynch &amp; Thorn (in press) on the same treatments, suggesting a possible levelling off of the species accumulation curves in some treatments sampled.

  abstract: Above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) is an important measure of the response of ecosystems to explicit management activities as well as to edaphic features within a landscape.&nbsp; At the Kellogg Biological Station LTER, ANPP is measured in systems across a wide gradient of management intensity, including annual crops, perennial crops, and&nbsp; forests in various stages of succession.&nbsp; Here, we compare the productivity of cropped systems and successional forests on an annual basis for the period 1999 to 2002.&nbsp; Within a single landscape, such a comparison helps to emphasize differences in nutrient cycling and energy flow for managed systems versus the systems they replace.Approaches for measurement of ANPP tend to emphasize either woody or herbaceous vegetation.&nbsp; However, many ecosystems have significant annual productivity in both categories; furthermore, the relative significance of woody or herbaceous vegetation may change during a long term experiment.&nbsp; ANPP measurements at the KBS LTER require a combination of sampling strategies as well as an assemblage of data management techniques.&nbsp; Along with our annual cropping systems, we describe two ecosystems where woody growth dominates, one where woody growth is becoming important, one where woody growth is actively suppressed, and one where wood is harvested. Attention is drawn to the potential for inflexible productivity models to overlook key components of ANPP.

  abstract: "The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) is an invasive species from Asia that has become a major pest of soybean in the US since its discovery in 2000. Prior research has shown that existing natural enemy communities contribute to A. glycines population regulation in Michigan soybeans and can result in effective economic control. The differential disturbance gradients represented on the KBS LTER site are likely to influence A. glycines population regulation via two mechanisms. First, 14 years of differential management on the KBS LTER site have created differences in generalist natural enemy assemblages that may regulate the ability of this invasive herbivore to successfully colonize these habitats via top-down influences. Second, by altering soil and nutrient conditions, treatment regimes may alter host plant phenology and nutritional quality through bottom\x96up effects that may influence A. glycines intrinsic rate of increase. We present results from 2003 studies on the KBS LTER site that test three hypotheses: 1. Generalist predator communities do not differ among selected LTER treatments. 2. A. glycines establishment and population growth does not differ among the selected treatments. 3. There is no direct or interactive effect of predator community and agronomic practice on A. glycines population regulation in the selected treatments. These studies provide a view of the ecological factors regulating A. glycines populations under a variety of relevant agronomic conditions in Michigan and provide information on practical management options."

  abstract: Soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement in agriculture are two of a limited number of rapidly-deployable, high impact CO<sub>2</sub>stabilization options now available to policy makers. No-till cropping generally increases soil C stocks and enhances soil structure but its use has been limited in part by the perception that accelerated rates of N leaching and immobilization may reduce N availability and decrease yields. Further, several studies have suggested that increases in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions following conversion to no-till might offset some portion of the CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation making the long-term global warming potential (GWP) of the two systems similar. Our objectives were to investigate whether C sequestration associated with no-till cropping is associated with offsetting increases in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and declines in nitrogen availability and crop yields for a northern corn belt corn-soybean-wheat cropping system.

  abstract: Nitrate disappearance in sediments, an important process for improving water quality, is usually assumed to be due to respiratory denitrification. While performing tracer experiments in freshwater sediments of Michigan, we found that nitrate removal coincided with sulfate production, and that sulfate removal commenced only after nitrate was depleted. Because this activity appears to be biological, we hypothesize that the nitrate removal is due to sulfur oxidizing bacteria that use nitrate as an oxidant in the production of sulfate. Sulfur oxidizers do not necessarily denitrify nitrate to dinitrogen, but may instead produce ammonium via a form of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Push-pull experiments in streams, lakes and wetlands (23 sites) often showed sulfate production during nitrate removal. The nitrate introduction also yielded significant ammonium production and sulfide removal compared to controls. Further analysis using stable isotope tracers in 9 sites have also revealed the importance of DNRA as a proximate sediment nitrate removal process, but have shown that anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) is relatively unimportant. These alternative pathways of nitrate removal have important implications for water quality management, especially in the highly agricultural areas of the Midwestern US.

  abstract: Above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) is an important measure of the response of ecosystems to explicit management activities as well as to edaphic features within a landscape.&nbsp; At the Kellogg Biological Station LTER, ANPP is measured in systems across a wide gradient of management intensity, including annual crops, perennial crops, and&nbsp; forests in various stages of succession.&nbsp; Here, we compare the productivity of cropped systems and successional forests on an annual basis for the period 1999 to 2002.&nbsp; Within a single landscape, such a comparison helps to emphasize differences in nutrient cycling and energy flow for managed systems versus the systems they replace.Approaches for measurement of ANPP tend to emphasize either woody or herbaceous vegetation.&nbsp; However, many ecosystems have significant annual productivity in both categories; furthermore, the relative significance of woody or herbaceous vegetation may change during a long term experiment.&nbsp; ANPP measurements at the KBS LTER require a combination of sampling strategies as well as an assemblage of data management techniques.&nbsp; Along with our annual cropping systems, we describe two ecosystems where woody growth dominates, one where woody growth is becoming important, one where woody growth is actively suppressed, and one where wood is harvested. Attention is drawn to the potential for inflexible productivity models to overlook key components of ANPP.

Volumetric soil water contents of the same horizons were measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR) at every sampling date.

Maximum N-NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, of 108 and 104 &micro;g g<sup>-1</sup> were observed in the Ap horizons for treatment BT in October-November and December for B.

This difference can be explained by a differential drainage flux, as soil volumetric water contents were consistently higher for BT than B. The presence of living root systems induced much higher recharge rates after precipitation compared to the bare soil treatments. Soil extractions conducted in May 1996 showed that treatments B and BT had accumulated 8 times more N-NO<sub>3</sub> in the upper 150 cm of the soil profile than did A and AT.</font><font size="2">Maximum quantities of N-NO<sub>3</sub> were found in the C horizons. This suggests that much of the N-NO<sub>3</sub> which has not been absorbed or immobilized is leached to depths greater than 1 m. At the first harvest, alfalfa shoots were broadcasted on the BT and AT plots. The plant regrowth appeared to be impeded by the residues in the AT plots. The following harvests were conducted with alfalfa shoots applied by hand in between the rows. By the fourth harvest, AT yields were significantly higher than A yields. This indicates that the decomposition products of alfalfa shoots are not directly or indirectly (soil pathogens, ...) harmful to a well established alfalfa stand.</font>

  abstract: Agriculture lime can be a source or a sink for CO<sub>2</sub>, depending on whether reaction occurs with strong acids or carbonic acid. Here we examine the impact of liming on global warming potential by comparing the sum of Ca and Mg to carbonate alkalinity in soil solutions beneath unmanaged vegetation vs. limed row crops, and of streams and rivers in agricultural vs. forested watersheds, mainly in southern Michigan. Soil solutions sampled by tension indicated that lime can act as either a source or a sink for CO<sub>2</sub>. However, infiltrating waters tended to indicate net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, as did tile drainage waters and streams draining agricultural watersheds. As nitrate concentrations increased in infiltrating waters, lime switched from a net CO<sub>2</sub> sink to a source, implying nitrification as a major acidifying process. Dissolution of lime may sequester CO<sub>2</sub> equal to roughly half of its C content, in contrast to the prevailing assumption that all of the carbon in lime becomes CO<sub>2</sub>. The ~30 Tg/y of agricultural lime applied in the U.S. could thus sequester 1.9 Tg C/y, about 15% of the annual change in the U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (12 Tg C/y for 2002-2003). The implications of liming for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization should be considered in strategies to mitigate global climate change.

  abstract: The quantitative characterization of spatio-temporal variability in crop grain yields is an important component for successful precision agriculture applications. The objective of this study was to analyze and quantify effects of management practices and weather conditions on spatial variability patterns of crop yields based on the data collected at the Long Term Ecological Research site (Michigan). The treatments used in this study were two treatments with conventional chemical inputs (chisel plow and no-till) and two organic-based chisel plowed treatments with a winter leguminous cover crop (low chemical input and zero chemical input). The data consisted of corn-soybean-wheat yields collected via combine monitors from 1996 to 2001. The studied yield variability characteristics included coefficient of variation and sample variogram behavior near the origin. Stressful conditions, regardless of the stress origin, increased the overall yield variability (coefficient of variation) as well as the small scale yield variability (variogram nuggets and variogram slopes near the origin) making yields more sensitive to the small scale variations in growth conditions due to soil and micro-topographical differences. During the years with low precipitation both the coefficients of variation and the small scale variability were often significantly higher in the zero chemical input treatment than in the treatments that received fertilizer inputs.

  abstract: In this project we ask how political economy, culture and biogeography have combined to produce a series of transformations in the roles of cereal grains in the agricultural landscape of southwest Michigan. The environmental and social history of the region has been divided into six time periods. Across these six periods, cereal grains shift from a diversified mixture with an emphasis on wheat for food production, to a specialization in corn and soybeans for animal feed. The heavy emphasis on corn production created very hospitable habitats for corn pests. In the early part of the last century, European corn borer spread through the region, and farmers were encouraged to practice clean cultivation in order to decrease overwintering by the pest. The emphasis on clean cultivation in turn increased rates of soil erosion, so farmers were encouraged to use no-till techniques. As no-till techniques lead to increases in weed pressure, the use of herbicides is increased and contamination of groundwater occurs. Although soybean crops provide some residual nitrogen for successive corn crops, supplemental nitrogen is used extensively, leading to pollution of surface and subsurface waters.

  abstract: This research synthesizes patterns of response of eight species of Coccinellidae, generalist insect predators of plant inhabiting herbivores, to an array of management regimes in a variety of plant communities and cropping systems implemented at the KBS LTER. The work is based on a 14-year project aimed to examine ecological principles as substitutes for chemical subsidies in agricultural ecosystems. This project also relates to the LTER Network theme of trophic dynamics in space and time. Weekly species counts of adult beetles have been made from May through August at 210 permanent locations. The sample array covers all seven KBS LTER treatments, cropping rotations and plant communities. The resulting 444,000 observations of insect abundance have been stored in a relational database, and linked to 14 years of daily weather observations to provide a spatial-temporal landscape scale response to treatment and plant community regimes. In addition, a system has been developed to automate the production of distribution maps for 8 species of insect predators at intervals of 100, 200, 400 and 1200 degree days over the 14 year time span resulting in 2600 distribution maps. This spatial-temporal database is being analyzed to model the numerical response of these species to changing plant communities, cropping patterns, treatment manipulation and meteorological conditions. During the observation period we have quantified natural biological regulation of a plant herbivore, documented the outbreak of two exotic species, examined the interaction of exotic and native predators, quantified the response of species to changing plant growth and characterized long term population trends in predators.

In the LTER sites, including the KBS LTER, there are varying levels of emphasis on simulation modeling to scale up site research findings to the region each represents. To stimulate efforts to model regional ecological processes for the 23 LTER sites, we are coordinating a set of workshops sponsored by the LTER Office in collaboration with the National Partnership for Advanced Computation Infrastructure (NPACI). The first workshop, entitled "Modeling of Ecosystem Processes at Regional Scales", was held at the San Diego Supercomputer Center in 1998 to facilitate an examination of existing and developing regional models of ecological processes. This workshop was highly successful in that it brought together modelers and would-be modelers of regional ecological processes from 13 of the 23 LTER Sites. The outcome of the SDSC Workshop was to encourage the LTER Community to:All-Scientists Year 2000 Meeting to inform the LTER Research Community of the activities aimed at developing strategies to build and use regional models to characterize the Region represented by LTER sites. The objectives of this workshop are to:The KBS LTER (Gage, Colunga, Skole, and Safir) will participate in this workshop using the CMAIZE model as a case study to demonstrate the use of a modeling interface to remotely manage model input/output data and to visualize the results.

  abstract: Grasslands and oak savannas were extensive in the Great Lakes region at the time of European settlement. Settlement resulted in the conversion of forest and grassland openings to small farms and villages. These agricultural activities, together with fire-suppression, suburban sprawl, and the introduction of non-native species, resulted in increasing fragmentation and degradation of the remaining small areas of &#226;&#8364;&#732;pristine habitat&#226;&#8364;&#8482; in the region. There is increasing concern about (and both legal and public support for) the restoration of prairies and savannas in the region. However, there are only limited numbers of studies that can be used to guide restoration efforts here. The W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) has a rich history of research related to understanding the mechanisms of succession following the abandonment of agricultural lands, which can inform future restoration efforts. Here we review observational and experimental studies of old-field succession at the KBS LTER. On the LTER mainsite, six replicate 1ha plots were abandoned in 1989. Despite initial differences in composition, these fields converged to similar plant communities within six years, and the ratio of native-to-non-native species leveled out at around 1:1. Prescribed burns were introduced in these plots in 1997, and may explain this convergence. In three different reference mid-successional old-fields near the KBS mainsite, species composition is very dynamic even 40-60 years after field abandonment. Differences in community vegetation patterns across these fields can be attributed to past land use, successional age, and geographic location of these sites. Taken together, the patterns of succession observed over the last fifteen years in both the reference and experimental old-field communities at the KBS LTER offer insight into how successional processes in the Midwestern U.S. can guide grassland restoration efforts. Land-use history, geographic location, disturbance regimes, and seed sources all play important roles in setting the trajectory of successional communities.

  abstract: The soybean aphid (<i>Aphis glycines</i> Matsumura) is an invasive species from Asia that has become a major pest of soybean in the US since its discovery in 2000. Prior research has shown that existing natural enemy communities contribute to <i>A. glycines</i> population regulation in Michigan soybeans and can result in effective economic control. The differential disturbance gradients represented on the KBS LTER site are likely to influence <i>A. glycines</i> population regulation via two mechanisms. First, 14 years of differential management on the KBS LTER site have created differences in generalist natural enemy assemblages that may regulate the ability of this invasive herbivore to successfully colonize these habitats via top-down influences. Second, by altering soil and nutrient conditions, treatment regimes may alter host plant phenology and nutritional quality through bottom&#8211;up effects that may influence <i>A. glycines</i> intrinsic rate of increase. We found no consistent evidence of bottom-up effects of agronomic treatments on aphid increase under a wide range of chemical input levels.&nbsp; We did detect strong evidence of top-down control on aphid population with predator exclusion resulting in a 3 to 11 fold increase of aphid population in comparison with the controls. Our study suggests that generalist predator communities appear to be more important than host plant quality in regulation aphid population dynamics under the range of agronomic regimes we studied.&nbsp; However, bottom-up influences could be important in other crops or years.&nbsp; Our findings also suggest that predation maintained <i>A. glycines</i> populations below estimated economic thresholds for most of the season, and that enhancing natural enemy impacts during the mid-season may be necessary to improve biological control.

Larval bluegill (BG) are gape limited and rely on microzooplankton during the first weeks of life. Zebra mussels consume microzooplankton and have been shown to have a large impact on both the total biomass and relative abundance of zooplankton in systems other than inland lakes. To test whether and how zebra mussels might affect the growth of larval bluegill, a mesocosm experiment with three replicates of four treatments (ZM, BG, ZM + BG, and control) was conducted. Hatchling bluegill were collected from local lakes, reared in the lab, and upon reaching the swimming stage transferred to 1,500 L mesocosms.

An additional "macro plot" area in this treatment is plowed in early spring each year to create an annually disturbed community that we can compare to the agronomic treatments (1-4) and the undisturbed successional plots.

  abstract: "The ability to hear and to interpret sound is one of our basic senses. Sounds produced by the environment are an untapped resource to enable humans to assess the health of the ecosystems within which they live or extract resources. The arrays of sounds in a place depend on the habitat type, the mosaic of habitats in the landscape, the time of day, and the season of the year. We have hypothesize that sounds also reflect the status of the ecosystems. Many groups of animals produce sound and use acoustic signals to communicate. Patterns of acoustic signals reflect the dynamics of biological, social, and physical systems in the landscape. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of acoustic signal patterns reflect changes in those dynamics. The exact meaning of these signals, in terms of the processes and interactions they represent between social and bio-physical systems is a challenging area of study. A framework for the study and understanding of patch-level acoustic signals from a landscape is presented. This framework includes a) the definition of a soundscape, b) a taxonomy of the biological and physical characteristics of a soundscape, c) an analytical approach to quantify the components of an acoustic sample taken from the environment, d) a protocol for measurement of acoustic signals in the environment, e) a cyber-infrastructure necessary to manage numerous acoustic signals sampled from different environments, and f) a web tool to present acoustic information in near-real time from different places at different times. Our research has produced methods to characterize acoustics in human dominated ecosystems. Our findings are in three areas: <i>soundscape classification</i>; measurement of <i>diurnal patterns of acoustics</i>, and the development of <i>indices relating human and biophysical acoustics</i>. We present case studies to demonstrate the framework and outcomes of some monitoring and measurements of environmental acoustics."

  abstract: The sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils, now depleted in organic matter, is a well-known strategy for mitigating the build up of CO2 in the atmosphere. Full-cost accounting of the effects of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to quantify the relative contributions of all agricultural inputs and operations in determining net carbon sequestration. Such an analysis includes CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions associated with nitrogen fertilizer production and application, agricultural liming, pesticides and fuel use. By evaluating all sources in terms of their global warming potential (GWP) policy makers are provided with the best available information for developing cost-effective, potentially large scale options for greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture systems. Soil carbon storage is heavily dependent on the soil type, climate and the quantity and quality of organic material returned to the soil. The magnitude of carbon sequestration in response to management interventions is therefore site specific. Targeting of strategies promoting sequestration to highly responsive locations will ensure maximum returns. Identification of these locations across a region is possible through the use of simulations models which mimic terrestrial carbon dynamics in both space and time. Modeling at regional scales is complex, and thus has only been attempted by research groups with the necessary synergy of biology, modeling and computer science skills. A Modeling Applications Integrative Framework (MASIF) was specifically developed to process the large amounts of spatial-temporal data necessary for regional scale simulation experiments. We have incorporated a simple, but proven terrestrial carbon dynamics model to MASIF to assess the impact of tillage options on carbon storage in agricultural soils of the North Central Region (NCR) over the next century.

The project goal of maintaining soil pH and soil extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, and micronutrient levels within parameters acceptable for normal production under various cropping strategies was generally achieved. The mean soil pH value (5.6) for the unmanaged, untilled site (TMT 8) is significantly lower than the mean soil pH value (6.2) observed in treatments 1 through 7. The lower pH on the midsuccessional never tilled site (TMT 8) appears to be due to Ca and Mg depletion in the soil surface after years of weathering. The soil extractable levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are significantly lower in treatment 8 when compared to treatments 1-3 that had received fertilizer during the eight years of the experiment. These results indicate that differential soil extractable P, K, Ca, and Mg were not significantly different in treatments maintained according to best conventional fertilizer practices. The area under continuous alfalfa (TMT 6) did tend to have lower available nutrient levels than other agronomic treatments. The fast growing Populus clone (TMT 5) had the least impact on soil surface pH, P, and K over the eight years of the experiment, presumably due to the deeper rooted nature of the crop. Significantly greater amounts of 0.1 N HCl and 0.005 N DTPA soil extractable Fe and Mn were present in treatment 8 as compared to treatments 1 through 7 possibly due to the lower soil pH present in treatment 8. Soil test data confirm that establishing differential soil fertility levels when the beginning soil nutrient levels are high is a long term process regardless of cropping sequence.

  abstract: Non-chemical pest management involves many techniques and skillsthat require a greater knowledge of field crop system ecology than is generally provided in farmer and agriculture professional training. In response to this need, we have initiated the production of a user-friendly, full-color, multimedia Extension training manual tentatively titled Michigan Field Crop Pest Ecology and Management. Crop pests will be addressed from a whole farm perspective with a focus on designing agricultural ecosystems that prevent pest problems by depending heavily on inherent ecosystem regulation of pest outbreaks. Seven Michigan State University research and Extension specialists in weed, insect, disease, and nematode ecology and management are currently writing the bulletin following a process that emphasizes integration of these different disciplines. KBS LTER research results will be included where appropriate. A synthesis chapter, co-written by all authors and produced during a two day retreat, will be the capstone of the publication. Three farmers, one Extension agent, and one Extension specialist will provide important "ground-truthing" of the publication. The impact of the proposed document is intended to be long-term and will become evident in subsequent training sessions in which we will use a co-learning model to train farmers and agriculture professionals.Return to Contents

  abstract: Population models indicate that managing agroecosystems to reduce weed seed survival in soil seedbanks has the potential to decrease weed populations. A series of bioassays was conducted in soil collected from the Long Term Ecological Research site at the Kellogg Biological Station in Hickory Corners, MI. We determined the effect of 1) contrasting agricultural management, 2) burial method, 3) surface sterilization, and 4) mechanical damage to seed coats on the proportion of weed seeds surviving a 28 d incubation in soil at 25 C and 330 kPa matric potential. Weed species included common lambsquarters (<i>Chenopodium album</i>), field pennycress (<i>Thaspi arvense</i>), giant foxtail (<i>Setaria faberi</i>), kochia (<i>Kochia scoparia</i>), velvetleaf (<i>Abutilon theophrasti</i>), and yellow foxtail (<i>Setaria glauca</i>). Each of the four factors studied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affected weed seed survival. Seed survival rates of both giant foxtail and velvetleaf were 10 to 20% lower in conventionally managed soils than in soils managed with low, or no, chemical inputs. Burying seeds in mesh bags, a common experimental practice, increased velvetleaf seed mortality due to an increase in fatal germination, but had the opposite effect on giant foxtail seeds. Surface sterilization of the seed coat with 5% bleach for 5 minutes decreased velvetleaf seed survival by 7%, but increased giant foxtail seed survival by 40%. Survival of all six weed species was reduced by mechanical damage to the seed coat, with large declines in velvetleaf and kochia seed survival (77 and 83%, respectively). The wide range of weed seed survival rates in response to altered abiotic and biotic conditions holds promise for the development of agricultural management practices that reduce weed seed survival in soil seedbanks.

Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan. The Augusta Creek system is distinct from the other proposed sites because its waters are highly enriched in dissolved nitrogen (mainly as nitrate, presumably from agricultural sources), yet remain quite low in phosphorus. Stephen K. Hamilton is the senior participant in the MSU portion of this project. The MSU work is scheduled among the second round of sites to be investigated in the intersite comparison, and thus the experiments will be performed in summer 1998.</font>

  abstract: Agricultural ecosystems with their impacts in both biophysical and socio-economics systems are one of the main examples of humans impact on the Biosphere. The drivers and impacts of agroecosystems change with the scale of the analysis. A regional scale analysis requires an equivalent expansion in the scope of the temporal scale. Long-term analysis is achieved by the integration of historical data and modeling. Our research objectives include the analysis of historical maize productivity patterns in the North Central Region and development of the ability to explore future scenarios using a modeling and analysis framework.We have integrated a relational database containing county maize yield for the 1055 counties in the region represented by the KBS-LTER from 1972-1999, and daily weather information from 1972-1995. We are in the process of evaluating the regional variability of maize productivity in the context of historical climatic fluctuations. To facilitate this analysis of the analysis of future scenarios we have integrated a physiological corn model into a modeling applications system framework interface. This interface allows for data management and visualization of model inputs/outputs and facilitates the use of GIS and statistical analysis. In addition it allows the integration of satellite imagery as a means to achieve real-time model calibration.

  abstract: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), ubiquitous plant symbionts, play a pivotal role in plant access to soil nutrients in grasslands. Plants limited by either N or P provide carbon to fungi in exchange for nutrients. However, when N and P are abundant and direct plant uptake can satisfy plant growth demands, reduced plant allocation to mycorrhizae should decrease fungal growth.Previous grassland LTER cross-site research suggests that the growth responses of AMF to long-term N additions may depend on underlying soil N:P. At a site where P was abundant relative to N (low soil N:P; Cedar Creek), N additions decreased fungal growth. At a site where P was more scarce (high soil N:P; Konza Prairie), N additions increased fungal growth. However, other characteristics also varied among sites. We propose to experimentally test the role of soil N:P in mycorrhizal growth at a site where soil N:P is intermediate (Kellogg Biological Station). In a successional grassland, we will cross P manipulations with long and short term N additions. Long term control and N fertilization plots contain divergent AMF communities and light levels; single-year N additions may avoid these confounding variables. We will manipulate P through separate additions of P and gypsum (to reduce P availability). We will measure soil N and P, light, colonization of the roots of several plant species, plant biomass, extraradical hyphal biomass, spore diversity, and fungal community composition.If N:P controls AMF biomass and root colonization, we should see an increase in fungal growth in plots with very high N:P (N fertilization and P reduction) or very low N:P (N control and P addition), relative to growth in intermediate N:P (N control and P control; N and P additions). This experiment will test whether soil N:P drives the correlative results of previous cross-site work. Understanding the role of site-specific characteristics, such as soil N:P, will help us predict the impacts of N enrichment on plant productivity and reliance on symbioses.KBS is a critical site for this experiment because of its intermediate N:P and inclusion in the previous study. However, we hope to collaborate with researchers at other LTER sites in the previous study. By conducting N and P manipulation experiments at sites with pre-existing extreme values of N:P, we will gain a more general understanding of resource flows between plants and fungi and their effects on plant and fungal growth.

  abstract: A molecular approach was used to analyze the composition of communities of soil basidiomycetes in Kellogg Biological Station LTER agroecosystems that differ in tillage history. This approach combined soil DNA extraction using a FastPrep method modified to increase recovery of fungal DNA, PCR amplification using basidiomycete-specific primers, cloning and RFLP screening of mixed PCR products, and sequencing of unique PCR products. These fungi, primarily responsible for lignocellulose degradation in plant litter, are not easily cultured from soil and thus have been greatly under-represented in surveys of soil fungi.&nbsp; Shannon diversity, H', was largest in never tilled (4.08/3.76 June/October sampling), similar in historically tilled (3.34/3.60) and no till regimes (3.15/3.24), and smallest in conventional till (2.96/2.10).&nbsp; A significant (p &lt; 0.01) effect of both date (June and October) and treatment (tillage) was found using the FST algorithm.&nbsp; A high degree of genetic, therefore functional diversity was found in the treatments, inversely proportional to the magnitude&nbsp; of disturbance.&nbsp; This molecular approach should facilitate investigations in soil fungal diversity by avoiding issues surrounding traditional culture methods and provide insight to the community structure of soil basidiomycetes, and their sensitivity to disturbance by tillage.

  abstract: "Management strategies that are sustainable must provide yields equivalent to conventional agronomic systems, decrease environmental pollutants such as NO<sub>3</sub>, and increase the amount of plant available N in synchrony with crop uptake. Management practices that included crop rotations and compost change the flow of N in the active and slow soil pools on both a seasonal and long-term basis.Nitrification potential, the maximum capacity of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH<sub>4</sub> to NO<sub>3</sub>, depends upon community-population size and composition, as well as, abiotic controls. It is sensitive to short-term changes in management practices such as crop rotations, compost or fertilizer additions, and cover crops. High nitrification rates often result in NO<sub>3</sub> loss to groundwater and increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Substitution of compost for N fertilizer decreased nitrification rates by 25% without reducing yield. First year corn yields (averaged across cover crop treatment) were 68 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> on N fertilizer plots and 70.8 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> on compost plots at Hickory Corners, MI in 1998. The rotation consisted of the following crops: corn (Zea mays L.)/ corn,/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum). Nitrification rates in 1<sup>st</sup> year corn (220 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) were greater than those of continuous corn (167 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Cover crop treatments had higher seasonal nitrification potentials (190 vs. 176 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Nitrification potentials on agronomic treatments peaked in October. The successional grassland treatment peaked in April. Low nitrification potentials appear to be indicative of both agronomic and unmanaged ecosystems that cycle N efficiently and experience less N loss.Crop rotations and compost applications caused long-term changes in soil N pools. The initial size of the pool of mineralizable organic N (N<sub>0</sub>) from a 150 d incubation significantly increased from 1994 to 1998 (47 vs. 70 g N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil N) on compost plots. The amount of N<sub>0</sub> did not fluctuate after 4 yr of N fertilizer applications, 42 vs. 44 g N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil N. The mean residence time (MRT) increased in both treatments. Average MRT in April of 1994 on compost treatments was 246 d and had increased to 768 d by April of 1998. The average MRT on N fertilizer plots was 273 d in 1994 and 447 d in 1998. Lower initial mean residence times in both treatments during 1994 may be due in part to the 6 yr of alfalfa production prior to implementation of the rotation in 1993. The N<sub>0</sub> pool does not appear to have reached a steady state under compost management. The compost system has been shown to cycle N more efficiently than the N fertilizer system on a seasonal and long-term basis. The active pool of N under compost management is smaller but sufficient for plant needs and is in a less volatile form than in the fertilizer system. In the compost system, N equivalent to N<sub>0</sub> is predicted to become available for crop uptake in June of 2000.Figure 1.&nbsp; Nitrification potentials integrated compost and the successional grassland 1998<a href=\"Figures/ezanno_fig2.htm\">Figure 2</a>.&nbsp; Nitrification potentials integrated fertilizer 1998(Std. error agronomic treatments = 23 ng N g<sup>-1</sup> soil h<sup>-1</sup>)"

  abstract: An area planted with adjacent corn-soybean fields was monitored during the summer of 2000 to determine the habitat preference of dominant <i>Coccinellid</i> predators. An array of 314 sticky traps was set to account for midfield and edge habitat preferences. Insect adults were identified, recorded and removed every week. The dominant species were <i>Harmonia axyridis</i>, <i>Coccinella septempunctata</i>, <i>Coleomegilla maculata</i>, and <i>Cycloneda munda</i>. H. axyridis and C. septempunctata predominated in soybeans. C. maculata was more abundant in corn fields. C. munda was most prevalent in the edges between corn and soybeans. The temporal and spatial distribution observed in this study may reflect the species strategy to minimize competition for available prey.&nbsp;

  abstract: Field activities have been planned as part of the research program at the Basic Science and Remote Sensing Initiative of Michigan State University to investigate the potential of remote sensing for estimation of biophysical variables of agricultural crops. These activities were also included in a research proposal submitted to NASA to establish a long-term calibration site for EO-1 and its follow-on satellites. The EO-1 satellite will carry three sensors in the optical spectral region to collect both multi-spectral and hyperspectral data that are suitable for agricultural and environmental applications. One of the major objectives of the proposed activities is to carry out a field study to collect ground-based radiometric and agronomic data coincident with EO-1 and Landsat 7 overpasses in order to develop viable and practical means to convert EO-1 data into biophysical information.The proposed field study sites include a climatic gradient from arid Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, to temperate Michigan KBS, and to tropical <i>Las</i> <u><i>Alturas</i></u> Station, Costa Rica. At the KBS site, we plan to have the following activities:These activities will be initially for three years during the summer growing season. The field measurements are expected to continue as part of our remote sensing and land use program at the Initiative. Therefore, these activities will be a long-term research effort.

  abstract: "<font size=\"2\">Agricultural ecosystems are distinguished by their lack of structural complexity and diversity in plant communities that results from limited crop rotation and soil disturbance from annual cultivation. Disturbance in agroecosystems clearly affects productivity and plant diversity, with highly managed (high chemical and tillage inputs) systems having low plant diversity low high crop productivity. The frequency and timing of disturbance affects both the composition of the plant community and the distribution, retention, and utilization of nutrients within the system. The diversity of soil microbial communities may also be reduced in response to less diverse organic matter inputs and frequent, large scale soil disturbance.</font><font size=\"2\">Our understanding of soil communities within agroecosystems is more advanced with respect to the flow of C and N through various soil organic matter pools than the structure of the microbial community carrying them out. The importance of understanding the relationship between microbial community structure and function, within agroecosystems, has been long touted as a useful measure to evaluate how agricultural management (crop rotations, tillage, ag-chemicals) or environmental perturbations (drought) influence soil microbial processes such as, residue decomposition and nutrient cycling. There currently is an effort to use descriptions of the structure and function of the soil microbial community as potential predictors of \"soil quality\" or sustainability since changes in microbial energetics or diversity of disturbed systems can be detected long before changes in soil characteristics are observed.</font><font size=\"2\">\"Function\" (biochemical potential) of soil microbial communities within agroecosystems has historically been defined at the process level across various scales of resolution with respect to the activity of the entire microbial community. Microbial biomass has been correlated to C- or N-mineralization potentials, rates of residue decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, recent evidence suggests that although the size of the biomass is important in driving soil processes the functions of that biomass may be more critical to the rate and efficiency of biogeochemical processes such as N-cycling. Although the major functions of the soil biota (eg. residue decomposition, nitrification) appear unchanged in cropped soils, several studies have shown that soil disturbance related to tillage breaks down micro-habitats, lowers diversity and the ability to maintain resiliency of function. A dual approach using both FAME and community-based Biolog lends itself to linking the structure of microbial communities to their function or biochemical potential.</font><font size=\"2\">Soil samples from three of the management regimes at the KBS LTER site were examined for divergences in microbial community structure and function. Treatments were: a) conventional tilled corn-soybean-wheat (Zea mayes-Glycine max-Triticum aestivum) rotation (CSW); b) a successional plant community developing after abandonment in 1988 NS); and c) a plant community that has never been cultivated (NT). Each of these treatment alters the controls over agronomic productivity by manipulating organism-level interactions. A disturbance gradient exists through varying physical (e.g., tillage and frequency) and chemical (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides) characteristics in the treatments. The cultivated treatment represents the greatest disturbance while the never-tilled grassland the least. Differences in microbial community structure and function of soil samples from each treatment were determined by comparing the profiles of fatty acids (FAME) associated with lipids extracted from soils and carbon oxidation profiles of whole soil microbial communities using the GN micro-titer plate system of Biolog Inc. (Hayward, CA). The diversity of extracted FAMEs and of carbon compounds utilized provides an index of change in the structural and functional diversity of microorganisms present.</font><font size=\"2\">Microbial biomass increases rapidly in the conventional tilled plot following tillage and residue incorporation, early in the cropping cycle, and then declines with time. In the never-tilled systems, microbial biomass remains high throughout the growing season. Comparisons of extracted lipids from in situ soil microbial communities indicate a high heterogeneity in FAME profiles among samples within each treatment. This heterogeneity most likely results from spatial differences in resources and abiotic conditions. (<a href=\"Klug%20Figure.htm\">Figure 1</a>) illustrates the results of a principle components analysis for the 1992 and 1993 sampling years using a subset of the total fatty acids extracted. These fatty acids have been identified as \"bacterial markers\" making them useful to describe differences among treatments. Profiles from the conventional tilled treatments were 73 and 66% similar to the FAME's extracted from the successional and never tilled treatments, respectively. The major difference between years was a higher percentage of branched chain fatty acids recovered in the 1992 than 1993 samples. These fatty acids are common to gram positive bacteria. Lower recovery suggests a shift in the abundance of bacterial populations between years.</font><font size=\"2\">BIOLOG substrate oxidation profiles suggest that the heterotrophic potential is very similar among these treatments. There is however an indication that there is a greater heterogeneity of function within the successional plant community than either the cultivated or never-tilled treatments, as reflected in FAME profiles. FAME and Biolog are effective tools for initially characterizing differences in the dominant members of microbial communities associated with varying agricultural practices. Future studies are planned to identify and then demonstrate which selective pressures associated with changes in agricultural management drive the shifts in microbial populations and energetics.</font>"

  abstract: Many organisms change geographic locations during their life history using the atmosphere. They move experiencing meteorological and ecological conditions occurring at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. An understanding of the biological and meteorological interactions that govern the movement of organisms in the atmosphere is a prerequisite to developing adequate strategies for protecting human health and for sustaining a large number of terrestrial ecosystems. We present an ecological scaling approach that integrates concepts of spatial and temporal scaling to understanding aerobiology. We provide examples of the ecological scales important to the long-distance aerial movement of organisms and associated biological processes. An operational framework for ecological scaling of long distance biota movement can be achieved by linking spatially-static ecoregion classification systems with temporally-dynamic measures of vegetation phenology. Operationally, this approach integrates vegetation greening indices (NDVI) derived from satellite data with the less dynamic land cover - land use classification (IGBP) and the relatively static ecoregion boundaries. The correlation of the life histories of species, especially the timing of take-off, to ecosystem phenology through meteorological-based variables and indices allows for dynamic characterization of source ecosystems and can be used to parameterize atmospheric models to forecast the flow of biota in the atmosphere.

  abstract: In this study, we applied the CENTURY model to predict soil carbon at multiple locations by incorporating observed or predicted spatial soil texture data into the model. Two tillage treatments were studied, Conventional Till (CT) and No Till (NT). The simulations using the CENTURY model outperformed field average and multiple regression methods with smaller root mean square error (RMSE). The CENTURY modeling with observed texture information achieved the best prediction while the modeling with predicted soil texture from terrain attributes showed acceptable results of soil carbon prediction.Soil carbon maps then were generated using the obtained regression model, as well as the conditional sequential Gaussian simulations (SGS) based on predicted soil carbon from CENTURY model. The mean values from the SGS simulations were shown to be much closer to the observed ones than from the regression method. The SGS method had more than 20% lower RMSEs than the regression method in two of four plots we studied while in the two plots, the two methods resulted in very similar RMSEs.

  abstract: "&nbsp;Four research sites were used in research designed to develop a nematode community assessment protocol for assessment of soil quality. The research locations included the Long-Term Ecological Research and the Living Field Laboratory sites at the Kellogg Biological Research Sation in Hickory Corners, Michigan, the Long-Term Potato Production Systems site at the Montcalm Potato Research Farm in Entrican, Michigan, and the Cherry Groundcover research site at Cherry Bay Orchards in Lelanau County, Michigan. This abstract summarizes the results from each of these research locations.Approximately 75 different taxa of nematodes were encountered during the research. They include herbivores, bacterivores, fungivores, algavores, carnivores and omnivores. Early-season nematode population densities in the Long-Range Ecological Research Site in 1996, ranged from 544 to 952 nematodes per 100 cm3. Various ecological parameters were used to analyze the data, including the maturity index and plant parasitic nematode index described in the nematode ecology literature. Only simple trophic group ratios, however, will be included in this abstract.Long-Term Ecological Research Site.- Nematode community structure was monitored in three different soil ecosystems associated with old-field secondary succession differentiated by the number of years since soil disturbance. Early in the growing season, old-field sites that had not been disturbed for 30 years had significantly greater bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode and bacterial feeding nematode/plant parasite nematode ratios than those associated with the sites disturbed at the beginning of the LTER in 1988. A similar comparative response was observed for the disturbance sites initiated in 1995, at the beginning the project. The results from this research will serve as a basis for the understanding of nematode recolonization of soil ecosystems following soil disturbance. This is extremely important because of the vast array of soil disturbance associated with most current systems of conventional agriculture.Living Field Laboratory Research Site.- During the early part of the growing season, the bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode and non-plant parasite/plant parasite ratios associated with continuous corn were greater in the transition organic than in the conventional, integrated fertilizer and integrated compost farming systems. When nematode community structure was analyzed for the soybean-corn-wheat rotation system, however, the highest early season bacterial feeding nematode/fungal feeding nematode ratio and non-plant parasite nematode/plant parasite ration was highest for the integrated fertilizer system. Because of the temporal nature of the fungal and bacterial biomass in soils, it will probably be necessary to take nematode samples for community structure analysis at weekly intervals to determine the best timeor sampling in relation to prediction of nematode community structure.Long-Term Potato Production System Research Site.- The early-season bacterial feeding nematode /plant parasitic nematode ratios were similar for a system of continuous potatoes grown under conventional practices and an alternative system using composted buckwheat as the rotation crop. At the end of the growing season, however, there was a 25-fold difference between these two nematode feeding type ratios between these two potato production systems. The nematode community structure ratio with the greatest number of bacterial feeders was associated with the alternative management system and the greatest number of plant parasites was associated with the conventional system.Cherry Groundcover Systems Research.- At the end of the growing season, the bacterial feeding nematode/plant parasitic nematode ratio was 4.2 for a conventional cherry production system including mulch; whereas, the same ratio was 89.3 for a transition organic system managed by a professional organic farming consultant.Conclusions.- Although it has not been possible to develop a comprehensive nematode community structure protocol for assessment of soil quality during the short time-frame associated with this project: it was possible, however, to form the following three conclusions.- Alternative cherry and potato farming systems significantly alter nematode community structure.- While none of the Living Field Laboratory farming systems at the Kellogg Biological Station had nematode community structures similar to that of the Long-Term Ecological Research 30-year-old field succession site, it was possible to use nematode community structure to differentiate among farming systems.- Although nematode community structure is temporal and site-specific, the research associated with this project indicates that it has good potential for use in future evaluations of soil quality. It is estimated that about five more years of research data will be necessary to develop, test and validate appropriate soil quality analysis protocols.Return to Contents"

  abstract: "Accurate assessment of the distribution of heat and water vapor fluxes in the land surface-atmosphere system is crucial to hydrological studies, large scale vegetation mapping and climate modeling. At the regional scale the effect of intensive management practices on heat and water vapor distribution in the surface-atmosphere system is not well understood. A preliminary study is being initiated to evaluate the effect of intensive management practices on heat and water vapor transfer in cropped vs. old growth communities at Michigan State University 's Kellogg Biological Station.In-situ measurements of air, soil, and surface temperatures have been collected in corn, soybean, and alfalfa fields, grassland and forest sites since 1997. Additional parameters to be collected include surface reflectance, thermal radiation, wind speed and soil heat flux. These data will be used to analyze the heat and water vapor distribution in cropped and native forest communities by the surface energy balance equation, and the Bowen Ratio and Penman-Monteith methods.Contingent on the available funding, the long term goals of this study are to: (1) determine the spatial and temporal distribution of net radiation and ET in selected habitats at the KBS LTER site , (2) examine the relationships between net radiation, ET, and above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) in the cropped and old growth forest communities, and (3) compare the distribution of heat and water vapor fluxes in the land surface-atmosphere system in crop system representing high management and old growth forest representing low management. These results will improve our understanding of the heat and water vapor distribution in the Great Lakes agricultural ecosystems and will lead to reduced uncertainties in measuring, mapping and modeling vegetation under variable hydrological and climate systems."

  abstract: Most knowledge about the importance of microbial activities in soil has been obtained through study of microbially-mediated processes, and has provided little information on the distribution, relative abundance, and diversity of prokaryotic populations in soil. Molecular approaches to microbial ecology, such as those utilizing ribosomal RNA molecules, enable the study of microbes as they occur in soil and are beginning to provide insight on the structure of soil microbial communities. The 16S rRNA is an evolutionarily constrained molecule, allowing for the design of oligonucleotide probes specific for phylogenetically related organisms. In this study RNA is being extracted directly from soil and analyzed using rRNA specific oligonucleotide probes to determine the contribution of population-specific rRNA to total prokaryotic community rRNA. The microbial populations being analyzed in this study are the Alpha, Beta and Gamma proteobacteria, the High G+C Gram positive bacteria, and the cytophaga like bacteria. In addition, the overall contribution of Bacterial and Eukaryal rRNA to community rRNA is being determined.The objective of the proposed research is to characterize the distribution and relative activity of the above microbial populations in soils associated with varying plant communities and agricultural treatment regimes. Currently, three replicate plots representing treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have been sampled by pooling 5 - 2.5 cm x 10 cm soil cores from each plot. For samples taken in October 1996 the observed rRNA abundances have revealed no detectable differences in rRNA pool sizes associated with populations analyzed in the LTER treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. In contrast, the rRNA abundances of the alpha and beta proteobacteria, high G+C Gram + bacteria, total Bacteria, and total Eukarya were significantly higher in treatment 8 when compared to all other treatments (Fig. 1). No detectable difference was observed in the rRNA abundance of the gamma proteobacteria in treatment 8 relative to other treatments. No data is currently available for the cytophaga. The populations measured account for approximately 50% of the rRNA present in treatments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 75% of the rRNA in treatment 8. These data tend to support the hypothesis that historical land management practices can influence microbial community structure for many years after a change in land usage. We are currently in the process of taking additional samples from the KBS LTER and also from old field successional sites to confirm and expand our current observations.Return to Contents

  abstract: Research activities over the past ten years at the KBS LTER site have resulted in a high quality data set that is characteristic of agro-ecosystem at plot scale. To expand the findings at the plot scale to local and regional scales, however, remain to be further explored. Remote sensing provides indirect measurements of crop conditions at variable scales and, therefore, may provide a practical means to scale up the research findings at the LTER site to large scales both in space and time. To achieve this goal, we designed an experiment at the LTER site with a semi-permanent tower to continuously measure the radiometric properties of crops under various treatments using a sensor similar to the ETM+ sensor aboard the Landsat 7 satellite. The radiometric measurements at the tower will be used to develop a scaling scheme that link remote sensing images with crop conditions. The approach and some of the preliminary results will be presented in this poster. Challenges in scaling up local LTER findings to local and regional scales will be discussed.

  abstract: The weed seed bank in agroecosystems is the primary source of weed infestations each year. Tillage, crop rotation, and herbicide use influence the persistence, vertical distribution, species composition, and abundance of seeds in the weed seed bank. The seed bank at the LTER agroecosystem site was measured at site initiation in 1988 and then measured in 1990, 1993, and 1996 in each of the seven cropping systems imposed in 1989. In 1988 there was an average of 1873 seeds m-2 , with common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum Michx.) the co-dominant weed species in the seed bank. By 1990 the distribution and number of weed seeds was dependent on cropping system. The mean number of weed seeds m-2 was 67340 in the successional treatment, 23470 in alfalfa, and 5000 seeds m-2 or less in the other five cropping systems that included a corn-soybean rotation in no-tillage and conventional tillage with herbicide inputs, a corn-soybean-wheat rotation with low or no chemical inputs, and in Populus trees. From 1990 to 1996 the weed seed bank decreased in the successional community, and remained below 2000 seeds m-2 in Populus. The number of annual grass seeds in the alfalfa treatment was greatest the year following alfalfa seeding. Common lambsquarters and annual grass seeds increased in the conventional tillage and no-tillage corn-soybean rotation from 1990 to 1996 but the total weed seed bank in these two systems was less than the total seed bank in the low input system. Common lambsquarters and common chickweed (Stellaria media (L.) Vill.) were the co-dominant weed species in the seed bank in the low and no chemical input systems.Return to Contents

  abstract: <font size="2">This work is part of the grant "Ecosystem responses to catastrophic defoliation of Populus", a collaborative effort among entomologists (Mark Scriber, Dan Herms, Dylan Parry, and Olin Silander), biogeochemists (Eldor Paul, Phil Robertson, Craig Russel, Dave Harris, and Tracey Hruska), and tree ecophysiologists (Don Dickmann, Kevin Kosola, and Marla Fisher).</font><font size="2">How do poplars respond to severe defoliation? Gypsy moth caterpillars feed during June and early July. During this time, tree carbon and nitrogen storage pools are at a yearly low, as most carbon and nitrogen has been placed in the leaves. If most of the leaves are eaten by caterpillars, the tree has lost a large portion of its nitrogen at the same time that it looses the potential carbon gain from those leaves.</font><font size="2">Severe defoliation should cause both short-term and long-term changes in patterns of carbon allocation within the tree and in leaf composition. These changes in tree physiology will likely have cascading effects on ecosystem processes, as they can substantially alter carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes in the forest ecosystem.</font><font size="2">Bassman and Dickmann (1985) have shown that seedlings of Populus rapidly shut down transport of photosynthate to the roots following an artificial defoliation, as production of new leaves becomes the strongest carbon sink within the tree. What are the consequences of this on root composition, growth and mortality? We are monitoring root turnover with minirhizotron tubes. Regular sampling of roots from soil cores will allow us to track shifts in root composition, especially pools of non-structural carbohydrates. Will root mortality increase? Will mycorrhizal colonization decrease? Both are potential responses to lower carbon supply to roots that we will be able to detect with regular root sampling and minirhizotron observations.</font><font size="2">Long-term changes in tissue composition are also likely to be a consequence of defoliation. Increased levels of carbon-based defensive compounds are typically found in leaves produced after defoliation- a phenomenon commonly called "delayed induced resistance". The symptoms are similar to nitrogen stress, and, in fact, fertilization of trees with nitrogen following defoliation can eliminate delayed induced resistance (Haukioja and Neuvonen, 1985). We are monitoring leaf and root phenolic contents in fertilized and unfertilized subplots to determine whether phenolic contents increase in both roots and leaves following defoliation in a manner consistent with delayed induced resistance. Studies of plant-insect interactions most often focus on leaves- I am not aware of previous studies of changes in root phenolic contents following defoliation.</font><font size="2">Defoliation may also alter ecosystem water fluxes. Loss of leaf area will reduce total tree transpiration, and can potentially increase water flow to groundwater. We are monitoring tree sap flow in one plot, and simultaneously measuring soil water content.</font><font size="2">Large-scale defoliation can have ecosystem-level consequences in a forest- the poplar stands on the LTER provide us with a simplified system in which we can examine defoliation-induced changes in fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and water in trees, and follow the effects of these changes throughout the ecosystem.</font>

  abstract: <font size="2">Net primary productivity (NPP) estimates provide an important component in understanding the flow of carbon and energy through ecosystems. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is measured at the KBS LTER in habitats ranging from annual cropping systems to deciduous forests.</font><font size="2">The diverse plant communities in these habitats require different harvest and/or sampling methods. All measurements are taken pre-harvest at peak annual biomass for the major community components. This generally means physiological maturity for annuals and pre-senescence for perennials; most treatments are thus sampled at least twice per year depending on the life history of community components (e.g. wheat Vs winter annuals in T1) and on agronomic harvest frequency (e.g. 4 times per year for alfalfa). If possible, biomass samples are taken from each of five sampling stations within the hectare plot, although labor, weather, and time constraints may alter the number of sampling stations for a given harvest.</font><font size="2">For treatments 1- 8 and the SF (successional field) ANPP is assessed by harvesting all the above ground portion of plants rooted within the bounds of the harvest quadrat. Clipped plants are bagged and stored at 4 C until botanical separations are performed. Harvested plants are separated by species and identified using the five letter Bayer code system. Crops are further separated into seed and stover. Plants are dried at 60 C for a minimum of 48 h and dry weights recorded, along with the date of harvest, field replicate, treatment, sampling station and species code. In the poplar systems (T5), wood biomass estimates are derived using basal diameter measurements in relation to allometric equations developed from whole-tree harvest on site. For the forested (CF and DF) sites, wood growth increments are measured with dendrometers bands on trees with &gt; 10 cm dbh. Dendrometers were installed in the summer of 1995 and woody increment growth will be available in the fall of 1996. Leaf production in sites with trees is estimated with leaf litter traps placed on the forest floor.</font><font size="2">Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) for 1995 differed considerably between treatments (<a href="Halstead%20Figure.htm">Figure 1</a>). ANPP in the perennial cropping systems, T5 poplars and T6 alfalfa, far exceeded biomass as the annual cropping systems or the successional treatments. Annual poplar wood production was twice that of wheat biomass and four times greater than successional vegetation production. Productivity in the annual cropping systems, T1-T4 wheat, did not differ between conventional and notill management and was lower for plots with low (T3) or zero chemical input (T4). Successional field biomass (T7, T8, and T-SF) varied greatly across sites and was highest in grass dominated plots. Annual wood production and forest understory composition and biomass in the DF and CF treatments will be measured beginning in 1996.</font>

  abstract: "Communication is a fundamental sense of the animal world comprising of both the emission and capture of acoustics. Acoustic variables are used in ecology to census organisms (birds, amphibians, mammals, insects, etc.) and to identify signatures of sounds of human activities and ecological communications. A framework for the study and understanding of patch-level acoustic signals from a landscape is presented. This framework includes a) a taxonomy of the biological and physical characteristics of a soundscape, b) an analytical approach to quantify the components of acoustic samples taken from the environment, c) a protocol for measurement of acoustic signals in the environment, d) a cyber-infrastructure necessary to manage numerous acoustic signals sampled from different environments, and f) a terrestrial sensor technology with wireless networks to measure ecological variables to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of landscape in near-real time from various places in a region. The study was conducted at the KBS-LTER. The sites were classified into two main ecosystems: agricultural and forested. Terrestrial habitat sensors with wireless networks were deployed at the study sites to automatically collect and transmit acoustic signals from multiple sensor platforms to remote servers within communication range. Our findings are in three areas: 1) measurement of avian species diversity using acoustic signals, 2) quantification of ecological acoustic variability at different times and in different habitat types, and 3) development of indices relating human and biophysical acoustics."

  abstract: "The Effects of Field Crop Ecology on C and N Pools in Sustainable SystemConventional farming practices can result in significant C and N loss from the soil. The use of organic amendments in place of N fertilizer can provide crop nutrient requirements, build C and N stores, and improve soil quality parameters. The implementation of sustainable agriculture techniques should cause C an N to cycle differently than in a conventional cropping system. Ideally slow and active pools of N in particular would increase in size and respond more rapidly to environmental stress. Sustainable agriculture management practices that include: rotations, cover crops, and compost change the flow of C and N in the active and slow soil pools. Fluctuations in C and N pools affect the amount of plant available N in a cropping system. Conditions under grasslands are ideal for C and N storage. Slow pools of N and C are larger and the grassland system is more rapid in responding to decreases in inorganic N as compared to conventional cropping systems.Field sites will be located at Kellogg Biological Station in Hickory Corners, MI. All cropping treatments will be located on the Living Field Lab. The LFL has a factorial design that allows for the comparison of a number of interactions. These interactions include: differences in management practices (Integrated-Fertilizer vs. Integrated-Compost), rotation effects, and cover crops. The rotation consists of the following crops in the order listed, corn (Zea mays L.)/ corn,/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum). Cover crops vary depending upon the point in the rotation. Crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) is seeded to 1st yr. corn, 2nd yr. corn is in rye grass (lolium multiflorum), soybeans have no cover, and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is seeded into wheat plots.The LFL does not contain a fallow treatment or grassland. Therefore, a grassland treatment on the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) plots will be compared to the LFL cropping systems. Four replicates of the historically tilled, successional grassland treatment will be incorporated into our research. The replicates that will be sampled on the LTER are: T7 r2, T7 r3, T7 r5, and T7 r6. Replicates 1 and 4 were not chosen due to the large amount of woody vegetation present. The LTER statistical design is a randomized complete block.This study will focus on the initial release of inorganic N from plant residues and compost, the incorporation of residue and compost materials into the active and slow pools of SOM, and subsequent release of plant available inorganic N from the active and slow pools. The effect each point in the crop rotation has on potentially mineralizable N will be assessed separately and in conjunction with cover crops and/or compost. The release of N from plant residues and subsequent incorporation of residues into SOM will be evaluated using an in situ buried bag experiment. Estimates of rate constants and sizes of active and slow pools of soil C and N will be estimated from long term incubations. The flow of C from corn and N from clover cover crops will be traced through particulate organic matter fraction (POM) using isotopic signatures, 13C and 15N. Modeling with SALUS will determine the length of time required for C and N pools in each system to reach a steady state. Our research will provide growers with information on the quantity of potentially mineralizable N at various points in the rotation and the impact compost and/or cover crops have on potentially mineralizable N. This additional knowledge of C and N cycling will allow farmers to manage: rotations, compost applications, and cover crops in a manner in which plant available N can be optimized at the appropriate time for a given crop. Modeling will allow us to simulate future effects of rotations and inputs. As pools of C and N in the systems reach a steady state, changes in farm management practices that may be required can be addressed prior to implementation.Previous LFL Soil Quality Research.&nbsp; Prior scientific investigators emphasized changes in N mineralization rates over a growing season as affected by crop rotation, cover crop, and compost (Willson et al., In press). It was determined that N mineralization fit a seasonal pattern (Fig. 1). Kinetics of the active N pool in compost plots were found to be significantly different from those of N fertilizer treatments. In the 1st yr of compost application mineralization rates increased 23%. Three years of compost additions resulted in: a 12% increase in the pool of mineralizable N, a 27% decrease in MRT, and a 28% reduction in inorganic N without decreased yields. Treatments that contained legume cover crops manifested short-term increases in potential mineralization rates and a slight decrease in MRT. Thus, the data suggest that the use of compost may increase C and N mineralization across the entire season (as opposed to several weeks) and maximize storage of soil C and N. This may increase active and slow pools of C and N, as well as, the rate of N and C cycling between active and slow pools.On-Going Soil Quality Research Related to the LTER.&nbsp; Previous research on the LFL has suggested that active soil N pools have increased in compost treatments. The rate of N cycling has been augmented. These increases should also be reflected in C pools. The completion of two rotation cycles may reveal similar changes in N and C pools due to crop ecology and cover crop use. A basic premise of sustainable agriculture is that inputs can be decreased and nutrient cycling increased without decreasing yields. The use of crop ecology and N sources other than N fertilizer are expected to facilitate C and N cycling between active and slow pools. Unmanaged systems such as successional grasslands are ideal for C and N storage. Slow pools of N and C are larger and the grassland system responds more rapidly to decreases in inorganic N as compared to conventional cropping systems. Thus, there is a potential agronomic benefit to applying ecological principles to agriculture.Carbon and N mineralization from 150d incubations on several agronomic treatments will be compared to treatment 7 of the LTER&rsquo;s, previously tilled-successional grassland. Treatment 7 will be used as a base line for comparison of shifts in cropping treatments. Grassland treatments tend to have greater C and N mineralization potential during laboratory incubations. A decomposition/POM fraction study has been initiated on treatment 7 of the LTER and several LFL treatments. Crop residues from the LFL will be buried in LTER plots. The decomposition and incorporation of crop residues into POM on the successional grassland will be contrasted with data from agronomic treatments on the LFL.Return to Contents"

  abstract: Distribution of root systems in the soil profile is an important factor in the determination of water and nutrients available to plants. A minirhizotron (MR) study was conducted at the Agroecosystem Interactions site of the LTER on corn and alfalfa root systems throughout the soil profile of Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) monolith lysimeters for a three-year succession of corn, alfalfa and corn. Multiple-date comparisons within and between years were conducted to estimate total root densities in each soil horizon. Root recolonization was assessed by comparing every video frame of paired minirhizotrons, from recordings conducted on successive growing seasons.In 1994, root populations of corn in the Bt1 horizon peaked 75 to 90 days after planting (DAP). Numbers of corn roots per m2 in the Bt1 horizon were consistently higher for no-tillage (NT) than for conventional tillage (CT) lysimeters, in 1994 and 1996. Distribution of alfalfa roots within the soil profile was not significantly modified by tillage. However, alfalfa root decomposition rates responded to tillage practices and were specific to each soil horizon. Corn root systems growing in soils previously cropped with alfalfa presented similar patterns of root distribution by horizons as that of the previous alfalfa crop. Successive corn root systems did not display similar distribution patterns throughout the soil profile from one growing season to the next. Proportions of roots of the current crop recolonizing root induced macropores (RIMs) of the previous crop averaged 18% for corn after corn, 22% for alfalfa after corn and 41% for corn after alfalfa, across Bt horizons and tillage treatments (Table 1). In conclusion, distribution of the corn root system appeared modified by tillage practices and by the root system distribution of the preceding crop.Table 1.

  abstract: "It is generally assumed that afforestation will lead to a sequestration of carbon. However, the processes resulting in a sequestration of carbon in afforested soils are still elusive. We hypothesized that the increase in aggregation with afforestation would lead to a higher physical protection and consequently an accumulation of carbon. At three sites in Ohio, forest, afforested and cultivated soils were sampled by horizon. Light, heavy and total particulate organic matter C (LPOM, HPOM, TPOM) were determined by dispersion and density floatation. Four aggregate size classes were separated by wet sieving and analyzed for organic C. At all sites, organic C concentration increased with increased aggregate size. At two of the three sites, LPOM of the A- horizon increased in the order: cultivated &lt; afforested &lt; forested. However, HPOM counterbalanced the increase in LPOM at one of these two sites. Consequently, we observed at only one site a higher total POM C concentration in the afforested soil than the agricultural soil. In contrast, in the A-horizon of all sites, we observed higher proportions of large macroaggregates in afforested soils compared to cultivated soils. These data indicate that afforestation leads to an increase in structural stability, but that this structural stability does not always result in a sequestration of particulate organic matter C."

  abstract: "SALUS (Systems Approach to Land Use Sustainability) is a model for long-term simulation of soil health. SALUS can simulate rotations of different crops and/or fallow with different management strategies such as tillage, residue application, irrigation, tile drainage, and nitrogen application. The model combines the crop and water balance accuracy of CERES with the soil biochemistry simulation of CENTURY. The generic crop module uses the same algorithm to simulate growth and development for various cereal crops, so that the user only has to change species and cultivar coefficients.Four years of data (1991&#8211;94) from the interaction lysimeters were processed and simulated. The data were sorted and converted from a raw state to spreadsheets and SALUS input files. The data processed to-date are: drainage volume, nitrate concentrations, soil water content, and root images. Nitrate leaching mass was estimated from water drainage and nitrate concentration. SALUS input files such as weather, soils, crop information, and management files were prepared from the data.Because the lysimeters drain when the bottom-most layer is near saturated, we simulated the drainage as tile drainage. We simulated the hypothetical tile at the bottom of the lysimeter and a restrictive layer below the tile layer. This approach significantly improves simulation of soil water content. Lately we developed a new generic runoff module for SALUS that estimates runoff from daily rain, as a function of saturated hydraulic conductivity and a time-varying parameter. The lysimeter data were very helpful in testing and refining the latest SALUS enhancements.Return to Contents"

  abstract: The LIDET (Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experimental Team) project was established in 1990 to examine the role of substrate quality and climatic factors on the decomposition and nutrient release dynamics of fine litter. Wheat straw is one of nine standard litter types distributed across the network of 28 sites, encompassing ecosystems from tundra to desert to tropical forest. Litterbags are retrieved annually for a period of 10 years and mass loss, carbon, nitrogen, and lignin analysis are conducted at Oregon State University (OSU). Data are shared between cooperating sites via an electronic database system managed by OSU.Decomposition rates are lowest in the tundra (Fig 2.1) where both mean annual temperature ( - 2 C) and precipitation (2.4 cm ) are low. The highest rates are in tropical systems (Fig. 2.2) with mean annual temperatures exceeding 24 C, however precipitation ranged from &lt; 2 cm to 21 cm with little effect on decomposition rates. Wheat straw decomposition at the source site, Kellogg Biological Station (Fig. 2.3) is faster than three sites with similar mean annual temperature (Fig. 2.4 - 2.6). The faster decomposition rates at KBS may be attributed to the native microbial fauna and the annual addition of nitrogen fertilizer to the agricultural ecosystem.Return to Contents

  abstract: Denitrification is the microbial reduction of soil nitrate, a crucial and often limiting plant nutrient, to nitrogen oxide gases, of which N2O and NOx are important air pollutants (Robertson 2000, Houghton et al., 2001) By monitoring denitrification, this process is useful in examining the impact of humans on a major biogeochemical cycle. Known controls of denitrification, including nitrate, water content of soil, and carbon sources, are known to vary along a management gradient, it is feasible that denitrification will also vary along a management gradient. I will compare the denitrification rates among the different management regimes, starting with conventional tillage, successional field, and deciduous forest sites. This experiment was performed at the Long Term Ecological Research Site at Kellogg Biological Research Station in Hickory Corners, Michigan. Since denitrification causes the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, my objective is to find out if some management systems reduce or enhance nitrogen losses through denitrification. This has implications for greenhouse gas mitigation, global climate change, and increased primary production due to greater nitrogen availability in the soils. This research aims to contribute to the regional nitrogen budget, for which denitrification currently stands as large gap in understanding and nitrogen accounting. All treatments were found to be significantly different in their production of N2O-N per gram of soil per hour (P&lt;0.0001). This could partially be explained by the differences in bulk density of the soil and resultant water holding capacities and/or nutrient compositions.Though numerous studies have shown that water content of the soil is a major predictor of denitrification (Groffman et al 1988, Tiedje 1987, Linn and Doran 1984), this study did not support that hypothesis. The range of soil moisture was from about 10-20 percent by weight, which may be part of the reason for the lack of significance (P=0.3828). Future research includes further analyzing the nutrient composition of the soil, and investigating correlations between denitrification and N content of the soils. This will further the development of a predictive model of denitrification.

Forty five degree-angle minirhizotrons were installed under corn in 1986, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 96, and 97. Horizontal minirhizotrons were installed in four large monolith lysimeters at the AI site in 1990 and recorded for every subsequent growing season. This very large data set is currently being analyzed for growing season variability and tillage effects. Early results suggest that for most growing seasons no-tillage induced greater corn root populations (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, tillage effects differed among growing seasons. For some growing seasons, such as 1986, conventional tillage induced significantly greater root populations than no-tillage for some soil layers (Fig. 1).This project is aimed at determining the environmental factors that control root proliferation at given depths in response to tillage management. Corn water stress and soil water content per horizon is being modeled for the12 year-period at KBS with CERES-Maize (Fig. 2). In addition, modifications of soil water content by tillage managements are being simulated using the SALUS model, as explained in part III of this abstract. Possible interactions between simulated soil water content and root numbers for given sets of soil depth, growing season and tillage management will be analyzed.Return to Contents

  abstract: The magnitude and importance of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a vector for hydrologic N loss has been largely ignored in agricultural systems. It has only been measured in the surface horizons even in the few forested systems where DON has been studied. The KBS LTER provided the opportunity to measure and compare DON loss between agronomic and forested systems. Teflon suction lysimeters were installed in the C horizon under treatments 1-7 and in coniferous, deciduous, and old field successional sites. DON loss in agronomic systems was low compared to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , but was 20 to 100% of total loss in perennial crops and successional systems due to generally low total N loss. Nitrate and total N loss tended to be greatest in the fall, but DON appeared to have no seasonality except in 3 treatments. DON concentrations were generally around 1 mg/l , whereas NO3 ranged up to ~ 60 mg/l. Nitrate loss was greatest under the four annual cropping systems. The low and zero input treatments had significantly higher nitrate loss than the perennial and successional treatments suggesting that increased N cycling, not inputs, are the cause.

  abstract: Organic matter simulation models are typically used to simulate long-term dynamics of soil organic matter. The Century model, which runs on a daily time step, has been integrated into a crop simulation model, called SALUS (System Approach to Land Use Sustainability). SALUS runs on a daily time step. We tested the capabilities of SALUS to predict soil CO2 dynamics on a daily time step. The model was used to simulate soil carbon dynamics of a moldboard plowed (conventional) corn/soybean rotation. Results from an incubation study as well as 14C dating were used to initialize the carbon pool sizes and the decomposition parameters of the model. The laboratory derived decay constants were reduced by 20% for the depths below 25 cm.The model predicted trends in CO2-C evolution within a year quite well, although it tended to under predict CO2-C evolution during the summer months; it does not yet simulate root respiration. The tendency of SALUS to over predict CO2-C evolution in the fall is attributable to the fact that it does not consider a lag period until the residues are colonized and comminuted. In accordance with observed data, the model predicted a higher CO2-C evolution for 1994 as compared to 1993. The higher rates in 1994 were attributable to residues from the previous corn crop. In 1993, the previous crop was soybean. The model when run for two years with pool and flux rate data derived from laboratory measurements showed a slight accumulation of crop residues and an equivalent drop in the Cs.Return to Contents

  abstract: We are using automated static chambers for frequent measurements of N2O emissions from soils under four different agricultural management systems (conventional, no-till, and organic soybean-wheat-corn rotations and continuous alfalfa). N2O emissions are sampled four times per day, and simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and temperature provide ancillary emission data as do periodic soil nitrate measurements. Fluxes vary smoothly over the time period thus far measured, suggesting that we are capturing most of the temporal variability present in the systems. N2O emissions often vary more than three-fold over a single day. Longer term trends appear related to soil moisture, temperature, and nitrogen availability. Maxium fluxes were nearly ten times higher in the conventional treatment than in the other treatments. Data will be used to test current models of N2O emission including DAYCENT.

  abstract: Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations of garnets and chain-silicate minerals (pyroxenes and amphiboles) were conducted to qualitatively characterize their weathering textures as a function of weathering regime, parent material, and land use. Samples were collected from soils developed on weathered glacial deposits (including an agricultural field and a deciduous forest at Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) LTER site in Battle Creek, Michigan and a deciduous forest at Sanford Natural Area in East Lansing, Michigan), and from deep saprolitic weathering profiles of the Carroll Knob Complex at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory Southern Hardwood Forest LTER site (North Carolina) and the Laurel Creek Complex (Georgia). The chain-silicate minerals at all locations and under all land-use regimes exhibit the same types of weathering morphologies as observed at the other sites, and as previously reported elsewhere, despite differences in parent material, geomorphic history, presence/absence and identity of secondary-minerals (weathering products), vegetation, and land use.Garnets from all Michigan localities exhibit a wide range of features, including features apparently inherited from their source rocks, and features formed during glacial transport. Widespread preservation of inherited pre-pedogenic surface textures suggests that garnet in Michigan soils has undergone little weathering since deglaciation. Garnets from the Michigan localities appear less weathered than garnets from other weathered glacial deposits in Canada. The garnets collected from KBS (both forested and agricultural soils) differed from those collected at Sanford Natural Area in that those from KBS have well-formed etch pits on their surfaces while those from Sanford are relatively unweathered. It is unclear why KBS garnets are more etched than Sanford garnets.Garnet weathering features formed during prolonged deep saprolitic weathering at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory Southern Hardwood Forest LTER site are distinctly different from those developed on post-glacial soils in Michigan, and closely resemble weathering features developed in many (oxidizing) lateritic and saprolitic regoliths. Pre-weathering (parent-material) surface textures are completely obliterated by weathering at Coweeta. Layers of gibbsite and goethite replace iron-bearing (almandine) garnet in saprolitic weathering environments; etch pits are uncommon on garnet in the saprolite. However, in many soils, almandine surfaces are directly exposed to soil solutions. These grains exhibit numerous well-formed etch pits. Garnet etch pits at Coweeta are larger, more abundant, and crystallographically better developed than at KBS.Garnets in Michigan glacial soils are minimally weathered compared with Coweeta garnets; this suggests that the relative extent of garnet grain-surface modification by weathering depends on the length of time the material has been exposed to weathering. It may be that the time required to develop diagnostic weathering textures on garnet is longer than the age of Michigan soils. However, chain-silicates in Michigan soils appear to have weathered to a degree comparable to Coweeta chain-silicates, so regolith age alone may not be sufficient to explain differences in garnet surface textures. Further work is required to determine whether differences in soil-solution chemistry among sites are sufficient to explain the preservation and apparent passivity of pre-pedogenic garnet surfaces in Michigan soils. Work to estimate the "response time" of garnet and chain-silicate surface textures to environmental change is in progress.Return to Contents

  abstract: Carbon (C) sequestration in soils is important for soil fertility and may play a role in short-term mitigation of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the mechanisms for C stabilization are poorly understood.&nbsp; Previous studies have determined that nitrogen (N) and soil cations, especially calcium (Ca), are essential to C storage.&nbsp; Our research evaluates the importance of N and Ca in stabilization of soil C.&nbsp; Laboratory incubations were established using soil from an afforested red pine plantation with relatively low C content. We chose this specific site because earlier field studies have suggested that soils under pine stands with higher Ca content have greater C sequestration. Incubated soils were amended with Ca, added at a rate consistent with adjacent high C soils and N at twice and six times atmospheric deposition rates for this area.&nbsp; The N and Ca amendments were added separately and together with and without incorporation of litter. The addition of Ca in the form of lime increased the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> lost in the first 95 days of incubation when compared to control soils.&nbsp; The addition of N at either 2x or 6x decreased CO<sub>2</sub> evolution over the first 30 days of incubation compared to the control.&nbsp; Incorporation of litter increased CO<sub>2</sub> evolution in all treatments, but lime additions consistently resulted in the greatest CO<sub>2</sub> evolution.&nbsp; Total CO<sub>2</sub> evolution during the first 116 days from the lime treatments included less CO<sub>2</sub> evolution, compared to control treatments, than can be accounted for by the addition of lime.&nbsp; As the rates of evolution for these treatments do not currently differ, total C losses from the lime treatments suggest stabilization of soil C by Ca addition.&nbsp; Increasing the incubation time will allow for better understanding of overall impacts of Ca on C.&nbsp; Maximizing C sequestration by increasing stabilization may be achieved by Ca addition, but requires greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling C storage in soils.

  abstract: The magnitude and importance of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a vector for hydrologic N loss has been largely ignored in agricultural systems.&nbsp; It has only been measured in the surface horizons even in the forested systems where DON has been studied.&nbsp; The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) provided the opportunity to measure and compare DON loss between several agronomic and forested systems. Teflon suction lysimeters were installed in the C horizon under replicated plots of four agronomic treatments, two perennial crops, early and mid-successional sites, and in both a coniferous and deciduous forest. The lack of significant differences in DON concentration between treatments, even given the wide range of inputs, disturbance, and plant communities, suggests that DON leaching is controlled primarily by hydrologic and abiotic factors. DON loss in agronomic systems was low compared to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, but was 20 to 100% of total loss in perennial crops and successional systems due to low total N loss. Nitrate and total N loss tended to be greatest in the fall. DON concentrations were generally around 1 mg/l, whereas NO3- ranged up to ~ 60 mg/l, with most treatments under 30 mg/L.&nbsp; Nitrate loss was greatest under the four annual cropping systems.

  abstract: Sub-plots of hybrid poplars in the Long Term Ecological Study site for "Agroecology" at the Kellogg Biological Station were experimentally defoliated using 10 million gypsy moth larvae. Half of the defoliated (and undefoliated control) plots were fertilized to see if this would ameliorate the predicted induction of carbon-based phenolic defenses in the regrowth of leaves. In order to bioassay the leaves of the four different treatments, we employed a continuum of genotypes (different hybrids and backcrosses of two different species of tiger swallowtail butterflies) with different abilities to detoxify these allelochemicals. Based on our previous studies with phytochemicals from the Salicaceae plant family, Papilio canadensis was likely to consume and process all Populus spp treatments, whereas P. glaucus predicted to either not consume or else quickly die on all Populus treatment leaves. Hybrid and backcross larvae of these two butterfly species are known to have intermediate levels of esterase detoxication enzymes and would therefore be likely to provide a continuum or at least varying degrees of sensitivity in bioassays for even the most subtle induction responses in the regrowth leaves. This presumption was supported in the feeding and growth studies conducted at different times post-defoliation during the 1997 growing season in Michigan.Fig 1.&nbsp; The relative growth rates mg &middot; mg-1 &middot; d-1) of penultimate instar P. canadensis fed hybrid Populus from four experimental treatments (+ with defoliation, + with fertilization, ets.)Fig 2.&nbsp; The relative growth rats of penultimate instar hybrid larvae (P. canandesis female X P. glaucus male) fed four Populus treatments.Return to Contents&nbsp;

These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternate food, isotope values of <i>H.</i> <i>variegata</i> gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9o/oo and 8.8o/oo for carbon and nitrogen isotope values, respectively).</font><font size="2">Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, <i>C. maculata</i>, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively.</font><font size="2">These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in variouscrops during the season.

  abstract: Impoundments change the characteristics of a water body from a river to lake, affecting chemical, physical and biological characteristics. Two reservoirs were sampled weekly in order to quantify the roles of reservoirs as sinks for nutrients. Lake Allegan is 1587-acre hypereutrophic impoundment, and is located 43 miles downstream of Morrow Lake, a 1000- acre eutrophic impoundment. No major tributary inputs exist between the reservoirs. Despite their spatial proximity, a Total Maximum Daily Load for phosphorus was developed for Lake Allegan to control summer algal blooms, whereas Morrow Lake lacks summer algal blooms. The inflow and outflow waters of Lake Allegan and Morrow Lake were sampled and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus, major solutes and chlorophyll &#1072;. In both reservoirs there is a decline in SRP from inflow to outflow, and increase in PP from inflow to outflow. Algal biomass build-up between Morrow Lake and Lake Allegan as the river passes through smaller decommissioned impoundments, which decrease stream flow enough for substantial algal growth. The cumulative algal bloom expressed in Lake Allegan is exacerbated by old impoundments remnants.

  abstract: "As in most terrestrial ecosystems, the productivity of row-crop agriculture is often limited by the availability of inorganic N. Nitrogen deficiency can be overcome by the use of inorganic N fertilizers or by the management of biological resources such as plant residues and organic fertilizers. An oversupply of inorganic N from either source can lead to economic losses and environmental contamination through increased leaching and denitrification. As farmers increase their use of biological resources in search of more sustainable production strategies, it will become increasingly important to determine how their management decisions effect the supply of inorganic N and to be able to adjust fertilizer recommendations accordingly.My dissertation research focuses on the effects of agricultural management and early plant succession on the storage and release of organic C and N in KBS soils. I compared the seasonal changes in N mineralization potential (NMP) with seasonal changes in C and N content of microbial biomass (MB) and macrooganic matter (MM) across a variety of corn-based agricultural rotations and successional treatments the LTER main site and the nearby Living Field Laboratory (LFL). I measured NMP based on the accumulation of inorganic N in soils during long term (150 or 310 day) laboratory incubations at 25&deg; C. Microbial biomass was measured using the chloroform fumigation, incubation method (CFIM) and MM was defined as the C and N content in the 53-250 m m and 250-100m m size classes of dispersed soil separates.Figure 1 shows the relationship between the accumulation of inorganic N in laboratory incubations and the MM C content of soils from LTER treatments 1 (Conventional), 7 (Historically Tilled), 8 (Never Tilled) and the tilled microplots in treatment 7 (Annually Tilled) across 5 sample dates in 1995 and 1996. The untilled successional treatments (7 and 8) had greater NMP than either the tilled successional treatments or any of the agronomic treatments. Among the agronomic treatments, those that received organic fertilizer in the form of compost and those that incorporating leguminous cover crops as green manure tended to have greater NMP than treatments receiving inorganic fertilizers and no cover crops. Nitrogen mineralization potential generally decreased from April to early fall (September or October) in all treatments, although it tended to recover in November.The strong correlation between MNP and MM shown in Fig, 1 was consistent across all treatments and dates in this study, although MM tends to reach maximum and minimum levels somewhat later than NMP. As a result, the relationship between NMP and MM C tends to change throughout the season (Fig. 2) with greater NMP per unit MM C in April and November than in October. A similar pattern was found in 1995-96. Our interpretation is that NMP reflects both mineralizable N in MM and the mineralizable N in recently deposited plant residues. The former is relatively constant over the season while the latter reaches a minimum in September-October.Microbial biomass was not correlated with N mineralization, although it was correlated with 10 day C mineralization. There was a dramatic decline in MB C in all treatments in June, 1994, apparently the result of a prolonged drought that spring. Microbial biomass tended to peak in the warm summer months (July-September), which also suggests that environmental conditions rather than substrate availability controls seasonal changes in microbial biomass at this site.These results are being submitted for publication as references 1 and 2 below. A third paper based on this study (reference 3) generates a simplified N budget for the LFL treatments and compares the NMP, MM C and N, and MB C and N measurements at each sample date to estimated field mineralization, yield, crop uptake and loss in the current and subsequent growing season in an attempt to determine which of these measurements was is the best measurement of N availability, crop performance, and N loss.Additional projects not related to my dissertation include the below ground productivity project (BGP) in which we are using 13C natural abundance to follow corn and alfalfa C into soil fractions and mineralization pools and a fertilization experiment in which I use 15N labeled fertilizer and 13C natural abundance to follow the fate of sidedress fertilizer N and corn C over two years of corn production.

  abstract: Macro-aggregates composed of micro-aggregates, primary minerals, cations, microbial and plant biomass, and organomineral complexations are stabilized by networks of roots, hyphal and organomineral associations within intra-aggregate pores.&nbsp; Spatial and temporal fluxes of cations, clay minerals, soluble organic carbon (SOC) and microbes within aggregates develop during multiple wetting-drying cycles as soil solutions diffuse towards aggregate surfaces and into intra-aggregate micropores.&nbsp; We investigated the C sequestration mechanisms associated with stabilization processes within macro-aggregates by determining the establishment of C and N gradients within multiple concentric layers of macro-aggregates sampled from conventionally tilled (CT), none tilled (NT) agroecosystem soils and nearby native forest (NF) soils. We also compared these C and N contents with mean weight diameter (MWD) indices of aggregate stability responses to wet sieving, their textural compositions, and their saturated hydraulic conductivities (Ks).&nbsp; We observed 2.2 and 1.6-fold greater C contents in NT macro- aggregates compared to CT aggregates from Wooster silt loam and Hoytville clay loam soils. Carbon contents were positively correlated with aggregate stability and intra-aggregate porosities. There were no significant gradients of C between concentric layers of NT and NF macro-aggregates, whereas C concentrations in exterior layers of CT aggregates from Wooster and Hoytville soil series were 36% and 8% greater than their interior layers. Both greater gradients and increasing total C in macro-aggregates were parallel with increasing porosities within concentric layers, whole aggregate stabilities, and the Ks values within aggregates of each soil type.&nbsp; These results indicate that C migration into macro-aggregates is influenced by the development and the stabilization of intra-aggregate pores that appear from increased microbial activity and accelerated influxes of SOC and cations into aggregate interiors during multiple wetting-drying cycles.

  abstract: <font size="2">Fluctuating asymmetries are small random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry that result from imperfect regulation of development. Recently, fluctuating asymmetry has been suggested as a tool for monitoring levels of ecological stress within and between populations. Unfortunately, such comparisons of fluctuating asymmetry may be confounded by genetic or age differences among environments. In this study we use a genetically controlled field experiment to determine changes in fluctuating asymmetry due solely to different competitive regimes. We determined fluctuating asymmetry in poplar leaf shape for leaves taken from an even-aged clone grown in six different competitive regimes. We show that increases in intra- and interspecific competition increase fluctuating asymmetry in the leaves of this clone. This supports the use of fluctuating asymmetry a tool for detecting common environmental stresses such as competition.</font>

  abstract: During the first 10 years of the KBS LTER we have assessed the response of beneficial insects to landscape structure in row crop ecosystems. We selected a group of plant-dwelling predators (ladybird beetles) to serve as indicators of biological activity in the agricultural landscape. This species complex is highly mobile and uses a broad range of habitats during their life cycle. The patterns of predator dynamics we have observed in response to landscape structure have provide an increased understanding of the dynamic role that predatory organisms play as chemical substitutes in agricultural landscapes. During the next phase of the KBS LTER we will continue our monitoring of ladybird beetle species. This is important because changes in plant succession and poplar, as well as the maturation of agronomic treatments will potentially affect the species composition of coccinellids in the landscape. We also need to document the changes in species composition in the community of native coccinellids in response to the establishment of the exotic species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis in Michigan. In addition to maintaining this long-term assessment, we will expand the scope of our observations to assess patterns of insect activity at increased scales. We will increase the number of species of predators observed, and expand our observation network to a regional scale. In this new phase of the KBS LTER and in anticipation of potential changes in weather patterns, we also will include in our monitoring efforts selected outbreak-prone herbivore species whose population dynamics are very susceptible to weather fluctuations. Changes in weather patterns can change the competitive balance between plants, herbivores, and predator favoring the outbreak of the herbivore populations.Return to Contents

  abstract: "<font size=\"2\">Land use history can have a major and often hidden impact on current ecological patterns and processes, and thus on our ecological understanding of a site. Over the past two years we have attempted to assemble a detailed land use history for the KBS LTER site dating back to presettlement times. Information for this effort has been gathered from a wide variety of sources, including historical collections at local libraries and at the State library in Lansing, tax record reviews, personal interviews with long-term residents of the area, and compilations of original field survey notes from the early 1800's.</font><font size=\"2\">The pre-settlement vegetation of Kalamazoo county has been described by at least five authors since 1900, all of whom base their deductions on the <i>United States Survey Field Notes</i>. Authors generally agree that the KBS area was dominated by oak savanna that was perpetuated by fires regularly set by Native American Indians. The Potawatomi tribe resided in this area at the time of pioneer settlement; to other tribes in the region they were known as the \"fire-makers.\" Their population in Kalamazoo county at the time of pioneer settlement (1830s) could have been as high as 1000.</font><font size=\"2\">Early surveyor notes of inner Michigan (pre-1800) depict the area as unsuitable for farming, a myth that may have been purposefully perpetrated by fur traders. In 1818 an expedition reported this to be far from the case, and settlement ensued. The survey of what is now Ross Township, which includes the KBS LTER site, occurred from 1825-1826. Kalamazoo county was organized in 1830, and Ross Township in 1839. The pioneer era is generally agreed to have ended in 1840.</font><font size=\"2\">KBS lands in Kalamazoo County reside in Sections 4-9 of Ross township. These sections were first purchased from 1834-1837, with most lands being purchased in 1836. At the time of purchase, 60% of Ross Township landowners were not known residents of the township, 20% were known residents, and residency of the remaining 20% are unknown. Nonresident owners were probably land speculators holding rather than developing the land; 4 of the 9 nonresident owners in the township owned land in 2 sections of sections 4-9.</font><font size=\"2\">From 1839-1849, nonresidents owned the land comprising the main site of the LTER in section 4. In 1850 the site was bought by John Finley, who resided on site until 1869. By 1873, he had sold this property to F.W. Ford, also a resident. Ford in turn sold the land to J.K. Flower in 1910, who kept it until 1928.</font><font size=\"2\">It seems likely that the LTER main site was not tilled until 1850 when Mr. Finley, a resident, purchased the land. He is known to have been a 'progressive agriculturalist' who grew cereals.</font><font size=\"2\">In 1850 Kalamazoo county had 62,000 ha in farmland. Farmland area in the county peaked at 134,000 ha in 1910. At present farmland is back to 62,000 ha. The number of farms in the county had similarly peaked in 1910: there were 1,100 farms in 1850, 3,372 farms in 1910, and 745 farms today.</font><font size=\"2\">In Ross Township there were 2,200 ha in farmland in 1850, 8,700 ha in farmland in 1899, and 8,000 ha in 1959.

Potatoes, buckwheat, and rye were also common. From 1954 to the present, corn has dominated, with soybeans next most common. Wheat has gradually declined in importance. County forage lands were dominated by grasses from 1878-1920s, after which legumes became more prominent; most forages today are legumes.Cropping patterns in Ross Township show a similar trend for the 100 years of information available.</font>"

  abstract: Modeling at regional scales is complex, and thus it has only been attempted by research groups with the necessary combination of biology, modeling and computer science skills. A Modeling Applications Integrative Framework (MASIF) was developed to process the large amounts of spatial-temporal outputs from regional scale simulation experiments. MASIF incorporates existing commercial software capacities that provide the model analyst with the ability to rapidly summarize model results. One objective in developing MASIF was to provide an environment where a modeler can concentrate on developing a model that simulates real world processes without being encumbered with developing and integrating peripheral data manipulation and analytical tools that exist in the marketplace. MASIF enables visualization of model input data, model simulation results, and statistical patterns of information associated with model inputs and outputs. Two levels of utilization of MASIF for supporting regional analyses were implemented. One level was to evaluate the potential for incorporating models (SOCRATES, Sinclair's MAIZE, HYBRID-MAIZE), that project carbon outputs directly into MASIF and to utilize MASIF as a primary geospatial data I/O and data analysis platform. The second level is the development of procedures to couple model output streams from geospatial simulation models to MASIF. This system enables comparison of model outputs with observed data (e.g. remotely sensed information, agricultural yield statistics), cross-model comparisons and evaluations and to utilize the powerful suite of data analysis and visualization capabilities incorporated in MASIF. This framework provides the ability to link any simulation model to some of the general-purpose utilities needed to analyze geospatial and temporal simulation data and output. The MASIF environment provides us with a reasonably powerful and flexible environment that allows us to conduct creative regional experiments with complex or simple regional models. There is value for both stand-alone and network-based analytical environments for model assessment and application.

  abstract: Aphis glycines, a recent arrival in Michigan, is predicted to become a major pest in soybean. Its arrival in Southern Michigan late in 2000 has created new temporal distribution patterns among the coccinellid predator community. The populations of four species of coccinellid predators were monitored for 18 weeks during the growing seasons of 2001 and 2002 in a mixed corn soybean habitat. An array of 314 traps was sampled weekly and all coccinellids were identified to species and their number and location was recorded. The four dominant members of this family were <i>Harmonia axyridis</i>, Coccinella septempunctata, <i>Coleomegilla maculata</i>, and <i>Cycloneda munda</i>. <i>Aphis glycines</i> was monitored by counting all the individuals present on 5 randomly selected soybean leaves at 64 sampling stations within, or bordering soybean fields. The populations of both predators and aphids were mapped to show the temporal and spatial response of the predators to the aphid. The resulting maps showed a numerical and spatial predator response by all predator species except <i>Coleomegilla maculata</i>. The predator response also lagged behind the prey population peaks but never by more than a week. Community response by coccinellid predators to <i>Aphis glycines</i> prevented it from reaching harmful population levels during the study period.</font>Aphis glycines, a recent arrival in Michigan, is predicted to become a major pest in soybean.

  abstract: Defoliation effects on trees should cascade through the entire ecosystem, altering fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen as well as changing the quality and quantity of resources available to herbivores and to the soil biota. We examined the dynamics of changes in tree carbon allocation during and immediately after defoliation of hybrid poplar caused by gypsy moth. We found symptoms consistent with declining carbon allocation to starch synthesis and root production caused by defoliation. Both root production (<a href="Figures/Kosola_fig1.htm">Fig. 1A</a>) and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) in all root, trunk and twig samples (<a href="Figures/kosola_fig2.htm">Fig. 2</a>) were lower in the defoliated treatment. The effects on starch production were transient, and disappeared by the end of that same growing season. Contrary to our expectations, root survivorship was not affected by defoliation (<a href="Figures/Kosola_fig1.htm">Fig. 1B</a>).The timing of defoliation and the phenology of poplar both play a role in determining the impact of defoliation on the tree. Gypsy moth, as an early-season defoliator, does not remove leaves late in the season when poplar C allocation is primarily directed belowground. Furthermore, even during the highest population densities of 1997, the leaf meristems and youngest, unexpanded leaves were not eaten by the caterpillar, leaving a large potential leaf area ready to expand and photosynthesize as soon as pupation started. The trees were poised to recover very rapidly following defoliation. As a consequence, the LTER poplars were relatively tolerant to defoliation by gypsy moth.

  abstract: Research conducted at the Long Term Ecological Research Program for agricultural ecology and the Living Field Laboratory (both at the Kellogg Biological Station, MI) has resulted in the recommendation of using corn-soybean-wheat rotation integrated with the use of cover crops. These practices provide a more efficient use of carbon and nitrogen with additional environmental benefits aimed to minimize soil erosion and nitrogen leaching. Studies conducted with similar management practices in other crops systems have shown an important impact in the population dynamics of both pest and beneficial natural enemies. The experimental layout of the KBS LTER represents a unique opportunity to study the response of major groups of predators to a combination of habitat/management under the conditions of Michigan landscape. The objective of this work is to evaluate patterns of response of major predator groups to the management practices used for field crops in Michigan.

Crop simulation models can be useful tools to assess the impact of long long-term management effects on soil characteristics and crop production. However, existing models have put little emphasis on tillage. Hence, our objective was to enhance the capabilities of the SALUS-model so that it can simulate the various effects of tillage on soil characteristics.</font><font size=\"2\">An overview of the different modules of the model that deal directly with tillage is shown in (<a href=\"Schulthess%20Figure.htm\">Figure 1</a>). Crucial modules include soil water balance, residues, and soil temperature.</font><font size=\"2\">We have also included in the model new approaches to root growth and water uptake: non-uniform clumped root systems are accommodated in a new routine and water uptake predictions have been improved. Procedures are also being developed to assess the quality of solar radiation data from the past and future weather data at KBS and other sites. We have demonstrated that two seasons from different KBS weather stations had biases that could be corrected. Accurate solar data are important in process level simulation models because solar radiation has a major impact on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration.</font>"

  abstract: Crop systems are designed and integrated by farmers based, first of all, on economic and physical resources available within the constraints of climate. Design is influenced by farmer preferences, the regulatory environment, and a host of other factors (<a href="Figures/harwood_fig1.htm">Figure 1</a>). The selection of crop and cover crop patterns and diversity is based on agronomic research done primarily in an empirical manner. As ecosystem science is applied to production systems we are achieving an understanding of process-level and relational changes in the biology and biogeochemistry of production systems. In most cases production ecology research is linked to outcomes in terms of productivity, and the quantity and quality of ecosystem services. Rarely does it deal with economic efficiency and profitability. On the structure and input side, in ecosystem research rarely do we consider systems structure and inputs as continuous variables. We select specific "treatments" thought to give a response in the process under study. We then busy ourselves with the definition of the dynamics at the process level.If farmers are to include ecosystem knowledge in their design process they need information on how a gradient of inputs, diversity, or crop sequence affects ecosystem process which, in turn, influence outcome. Ecosystems researchers typically deal with inputs (treatments) in the most cursory fashion in the shortest possible "materials and methods" section of research reporting. That portion is of most interest to a farmer. It describes the treatments or "tools" available to influence process, and ultimately, outcome.As several of us work with you to translate findings for farmer (and extension) use, we will be extracting as much understanding as possible on "points of biological intervention (PBI)". We will be key-wording and categorizing them.The Living Field Laboratory (LFL) has been designed around gradients of plant diversity and chemical subsidy. Our students are quantifying and modeling how continuous management variables influence key soil carbon and nitrogen processes which, in turn, have a major impact on desired outcome. The research is specifically designed to bridge the gaps in applied fashion, between management, process, and outcome. We use relevant LTER treatments as benchmarks.It seems highly likely that the form of PBIs will differ with the type of process. Biogeochemical process information will be different in form from that of organism population structure, and different still for pest/predator relationships.

  abstract: Sampling has been conducted for two years from treatments eight, seven and a sub-treatment of seven, to establish a measurement system for the impact of disturbance upon nematode communities. Treatment eight is "traditionally not tilled" with approximately thirty years since disturbance. Treatment seven is "traditionally tilled" with approximately seven years since disturbance, at the beginning of our involvement. The sub-treatment within treatment seven was tilled at the start of this study. We refer to these treatments as 0, 7, and 30 years since disturbance. The sampling procedure calls for the same square meter to be sampled on each date, three times per year. Baerman pan extraction is used to draw nematodes from a soil sub-sample. The total nematodes collected from each sub-sample is counted, and 100 individuals are randomly selected for identification to genus. These genera are classified according to life history and feeding site. Several indices of maturity, diversity and stability are applied to the resulting data. The three treatments are separated by differences in several measures including total number of nematodes, percent of plant, bacterial and fungal feeders.Return to Contents

  abstract: <font size="2">Over a six year period, tree and shrub recruitment dynamics were studied in all six replicates of the KBS LTER native succession treatment (treatment 7). This study was carried out to document the temporal and spatial patterns of woody plant establishment and mortality occurring in early succession in old-fields of the southwest Michigan region.</font><font size="2">From 1991 (two years following abandonment from agriculture) to 1996 (final year of the study), annual seedling surveys were conducted during the month of May within each of the six replicates of the native succession treatment. In May 1991, a 10 x 20 meter plot was permanently marked near the center of each of the replicates. In the initial survey, all woody plant seedlings within the plots were marked and mapped to the nearest square meter. Each year thereafter, all newly established stems were marked, and stems marked in previous years were accounted for as dead or alive.</font><font size="2">Woody plant succession in these plots was characterized by increases in both the number of woody species (<a href="Foster%20figure.htm">Fig. 1</a>) and the number of woody stems (<a href="Foster%20figure.htm">Fig. 2</a>) over time. The strong increase in stem numbers between the fifth (1994) and seventh year (1996) following abandonment reflects both an increase in the establishment of new genetic individuals and the proliferation of clonal stems by the bird-dispersed shrub, <i>Rhus typhina</i>.</font><font size="2">Accompanying changes in species and stem numbers over time in these plots was a shift in dominance from wind to bird dispersed species (<a href="Foster%20figure.htm">Fig. 3</a>). In the initial survey (1991, two years following abandonment), the wind dispersed species, <i>Populus deltoides</i>, represented 66% of all stems marked. From examination of bud scars in 1992, it appears that the majority of the <i>Populus</i> seedlings present in the initial survey (1991) had established a year earlier during the first year of succession (1989-90). The average number of new <i>Populus</i> seedlings establishing in the plots declined from a high of 12 seedlings per plot in the first year, to zero by the fifth year of succession (<a href="Foster%20figure.htm">Fig. 4</a>). The number of stems of wind dispersed species remained relatively constant over the entire study period. In contrast, the number of stems of bird dispersed species increased by 123% from the second to the seventh year following abandonment (<a href="Foster%20figure.htm">Fig. 3</a>).</font><font size="2">There was considerable variation in woody plant recruitment among the six replicates. In the last year of the study (1996, 7 years following abandonment), stem numbers ranged from 43 in Replicate 3, to 387 in Replicate 4. Stem numbers where lowest in the two most interior replicates (Reps 3 and 5), which suggests that landscape position may have influenced recruitment patterns across the site. Woody plant species richness was negatively correlated with grass cover across replicates, suggesting that variation in competition with herbaceous vegetation may explain some of the variation in recruitment observed among the replicates.</font><font size="2">Although there was a high degree of spatial variability in woody plant recruitment patterns, these surveys document directional changes over time in the diversity and abundance of woody species, as well as clear temporal shifts in recruitment with respect to mode of dispersal. Future analyses of these data will focus on temporal and spatial patterns in woody plant mortality, and a more thorough assessment of recruitment patterns in relation to landscape factors.</font>

  abstract: "A long-term ecological program in agricultural ecology was established at the Kellogg Biological Station in 1989 with an experimental design containing seven treatments: four annual crop rotation systems under an array of agrochemical and tillage regimes, two perennial crop systems, and an early successional system. This design provided the opportunity to study the response of predaceous-arthropod groups to habitat type and management practices in agroecosystems. Predators studied included <i>Coccinellidae</i> (ladybird beetles), <i>Chrysopidae</i> (green lacewings), <i>Lampyridae</i> (fireflies), <i>Carabidae</i> (ground beetles), <i>Staphylinidae</i> (rove beetles), <i>Araneae</i> (spiders), <i>Opiliones</i> (harvestmen), and <i>Chilopoda</i> (centipedes).&nbsp; The overall pattern of response by predator groups distinguished between perennial and annual habitats.&nbsp; Most predator groups were collected in greater numbers from the annual crop rotation systems.&nbsp; However, rove beetles, spiders, and ladybird beetles were more abundant in perennial crop or native succession habitats. Habitat type was more important than management in determining the composition of the predator community."
