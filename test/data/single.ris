AB  - Production of biofuels from feedstocks that are diverted from food production or that
are grown on land that could grow crops has two important drawbacks: higher food prices
and decreased reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. If U.S. policy were to change and
place greater emphasis on food prices and greenhouse gas reductions, then we would
transition away from current feedstocks toward those that do not reduce our ability to
produce food. Examples of such feedstocks include crop residues, algae, municipal
waste, jatropha grown on degraded land, and by-products of edible oil production. Policy
options that would encourage use of these alternative feedstocks include placing a hard
cap on ethanol and biodiesel production that comes from corn and refined vegetable oil,
thereby forcing growth in biofuel production to come from alternative feedstocks;
differentiation of tax credits and subsidies so that the alternative feedstocks receive a
higher incentive than do corn and refined vegetable oil; and greatly increased funding for
research to hasten the feasibility of producing and refining alternative feedstocks.
