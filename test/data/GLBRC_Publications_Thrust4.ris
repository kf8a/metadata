AB  - Production of biofuels from feedstocks that are diverted from food production or that
are grown on land that could grow crops has two important drawbacks: higher food prices
and decreased reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. If U.S. policy were to change and
place greater emphasis on food prices and greenhouse gas reductions, then we would
transition away from current feedstocks toward those that do not reduce our ability to
produce food. Examples of such feedstocks include crop residues, algae, municipal
waste, jatropha grown on degraded land, and by-products of edible oil production. Policy
options that would encourage use of these alternative feedstocks include placing a hard
cap on ethanol and biodiesel production that comes from corn and refined vegetable oil,
thereby forcing growth in biofuel production to come from alternative feedstocks;
differentiation of tax credits and subsidies so that the alternative feedstocks receive a
higher incentive than do corn and refined vegetable oil; and greatly increased funding for
research to hasten the feasibility of producing and refining alternative feedstocks.

AB  - The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) provides researchers with quality-controlled bacterial and archaeal small subunit rRNA alignments and analysis tools. An improved alignment strategy uses the Infernal secondary structure aware aligner to provide a more consistent higher quality alignment and faster processing of user sequences. Substantial new analysis features include a new Pyrosequencing Pipeline that provides tools to support analysis of ultra high-throughput rRNA sequencing data. This pipeline offers a collection of tools that automate the data processing and simplify the computationally intensive analysis of large sequencing libraries. In addition, a new Taxomatic visualization tool allows rapid visualization of taxonomic inconsistencies and suggests corrections, and a new class Assignment Generator provides instructors with a lesson plan and individualized teaching materials. Details about RDP data and analytical functions can be found at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.

AB  - This study investigated long-term agronomic management systems and precipitation level effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] total oil content and fatty acid composition. Management systems evaluated included conventional (CT), no-till (NT), low chemical input (LI), and zero chemical input (ORG). Total oil content and major fatty acids profiles were analyzed by accelerated solvent extractor (ASE 200) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (FID). The results showed these four management systems have limited influence on soybean grain total oil content and oleic acid (O) and linoleic acid (L) compositions. The NT management system significantly improved soybean oil yield on a land-area basis as a result of higher annual grain yields. Soybeans grown under the NT management system had as high or higher palmitic acid (P) composition than the other three management systems; similarly, the CT treatments had as low or lower linolenic acid (LN) composition in soybean when compared with the other three management systems. The levels of stearic acid (S), O, L, and LN had a significant quadratic relationship (R2 = 0.64-0.75) with total (July-September) precipitation. The oil quality ratio of O/(L + LN) had a quadratic relation with precipitation.

AB  - Production of biofuel feedstocks in agricultural
landscapes will result in land use changes that may have major
implications for arthropod-mediated ecosystem services such
as pollination and pest suppression. By comparing the
abundance and diversity of insect pollinators and generalist
natural enemies in three model biofuel crops: corn, switchgrass,
and mixed prairie, we tested the hypothesis that biofuel
crops comprised of more diverse plant communities would
support increased levels of beneficial insects. These three
biofuel crops contained a diverse bee community comprised
of 75 species. Overall, bees were three to four times more
abundant in switchgrass and prairie than in corn, with
members of the sweat bee (Halictidae) and small carpenter
bee (Ceratina spp.) groups the most abundant. Switchgrass
and prairie had significantly greater bee species richness than
corn during the July sampling period. The natural enemy
community at these sites was dominated by lady beetles
(Coccinellidae), long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae), and
hover flies (Syrphidae) which varied in their response to crop
type. Coccinellids were generally most abundant in prairie and
switchgrass, with the exception of the pollen feeding
Coleomegilla maculata that was most abundant in corn.
Several rare or declining coccinellid species were detected in
prairie and switchgrass sites. Dolichopodidae were more
abundant in prairie and switchgrass while Syrphidae showed
no significant response to crop type. Our results indicate that
beneficial insects generally responded positively to the
increased vegetational diversity of prairie and switchgrass
sites; however, when managed as a dedicated biofuel crop,
plant and arthropod diversity in switchgrass may decrease. Our
findings support the hypothesis that vegetationally diverse
biofuel crops support higher abundance and diversity of
beneficial insects. Future policy regarding the production of
biofuel feedstocks should consider the ecosystem services that
different biofuel crops may support in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Background: Agricultural residues could potentially be converted to bioenergy, but the sustainable harvest rate is unclear. Results: Residue removal increases soil loss at rates that vary with topography, crop rotation and management; decreases yields (100-year mean yields changed -0.07 to -0.08% for every percent of residue mass removed); decreases soil carbon (approximately 40-90 kg C ha-1 year-1 per Mg of residue harvested); and decreases soil nitrogen (3 kg N ha-1 year-1 per Mg residue harvested). Conclusion: Even where soil loss is within tolerable limits, harvesting residue is a question of trade-offs in terms of reduction of yield and loss of soil nutrients. The effects of increased residue harvest are highly variable, depending on local climate and soil erodibility and it is thus problematic to apply a single harvest rate globally. However, on flat land under conservation management, the majority of residue could be sustainably harvested for bioenergy.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Advanced biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol are of great interest in the USA. With agriculture being the major source of feedstock for advanced biofuels, how farmers would respond to markets and policy incentives in providing such feedstock can directly affect sufficient and sustainable supply of advanced biofuels and their environmental sustainability. In this study, we developed an economic model to examine farmers' production choices in a context where agricultural markets are linked to energy markets. We identified the economic conditions under which farmers could maximize their profits by converting current grain cropland to grow cellulosic biomass crops. An empirical illustration showed that with current technology, farmers are unlikely to grow switchgrass as a dedicated energy crop instead of corn on cropland. The biofuel incentives in the 2008 Farm Bill can improve the competitiveness of switchgrass, but may stimulate corn production as well, with corn residues as an alternative feedstock for advanced biofuels. The continuous, possibly expanding, corn production in future raises the same issues for advanced biofuels as for corn grain-based ethanol. To assure the environmental sustainability of advanced biofuel production, further research is needed to help design environmental policies alongside existing biofuel initiatives.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope Regional variations in the
environmental impacts of plant biomass production are
significant, and the environmental impacts associated with
feedstock supply also contribute substantially to the
environmental performance of biobased products. Thus,
the regional variations in the environmental performance of
biobased products are also significant. This study scrutinizes
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two
biobased products (i.e., ethanol and soybean oil) whose
feedstocks (i.e., corn and soybean) are produced in different
farming locations.
Methods We chose 40 counties in Corn Belt States in the
United States as biorefinery locations (i.e., corn dry milling,
soybean crushing) and farming sites, and estimated cradleto-
gate GHG emissions of ethanol and of soybean oil,
respectively. The estimates are based on 1 kg of each
biobased product (i.e., ethanol or soybean oil). The system
boundary includes biomass production, the biorefinery, and
upstream processes. Effects of direct land use change are
included in the greenhouse gas analysis and measured as
changes in soil organic carbon level, while the effects of
indirect land use change are not considered in the baseline
calculations. Those indirect effects however are scrutinized
in a sensitivity analysis.
Results GHG emissions of corn-based ethanol range from
1.1 to 2.0 kg of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of ethanol,
while GHG emissions of soybean oil are 0.4–2.5 kg of CO2
equivalent per kilogram of soybean oil. Thus, the
regional variations due to farming locations are significant
(by factors of 2–7). The largest GHG emission
sources in ethanol production are N2O emissions from soil
during corn cultivation and carbon dioxide from burning
the natural gas used in corn dry milling. The second largest
GHG emission source groups in the ethanol production
system are nitrogen fertilizer (8–12%), carbon sequestration
by soil (−15–2%), and electricity used in corn dry milling
(7–16%). The largest GHG emission sources in soybean oil
production are N2O emissions from soil during soybean
cultivation (13–57%) and carbon dioxide from burning the
natural gas used in soybean crushing (21–47%). The second
largest GHG emission source groups in soybean oil
production are carbon sequestration by soil (−29–24%),
diesel used in soybean cultivation (4–24%), and electricity
used in the soybean crushing process (10–21%). The
indirect land use changes increase GHG emissions of
ethanol by 7–38%, depending on the fraction of forest
converted when newly converted croplands maintain crop
cultivation for 100 years.
Conclusions, recommendations, and perspectives Farming
sites with higher biomass yields, lower nitrogen fertilizer
application rates, and less tillage are favorable to future
biorefinery locations in terms of global warming. For
existing biorefineries, farmers are encouraged to apply a
site-specific optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate, to
convert to no-tillage practices and also to adopt winter
cover practices whenever possible to reduce the GHG
emissions of their biobased products. Current practices for
estimating the effects of indirect land use changes suffer
from large uncertainties. More research and consensus
about system boundaries and allocation issues are needed
to reduce uncertainties related to the effects of indirect land
use changes.

AB  - Increased demand for corn grain as an ethanol feedstock is altering U.S. agricultural landscapes and the ecosystem services they provide. From 2006 to 2007, corn acreage increased 19% nationally, resulting in reduced crop diversity in many areas. Biological control of insects is an ecosystem service that is strongly influenced by local landscape structure. Here, we estimate the value of natural biological control of the soybean aphid, a major pest in agricultural landscapes, and the economic impacts of reduced biocontrol caused by increased corn production in 4 U.S. states (Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). For producers who use an integrated pest management strategy including insecticides as needed, natural suppression of soybean aphid in soybean is worth an average of $33 ha(-1). At 2007-2008 prices these services are worth at least $239 million y(-1) in these 4 states. Recent biofuel-driven growth in corn planting results in lower landscape diversity, altering the supply of aphid natural enemies to soybean fields and reducing biocontrol services by 24%. This loss of biocontrol services cost soybean producers in these states an estimated $58 million y(-1) in reduced yield and increased pesticide use. For producers who rely solely on biological control, the value of lost services is much greater. These findings from a single pest in 1 crop suggest that the value of biocontrol services to the U.S. economy may be underestimated. Furthermore, we suggest that development of cellulosic ethanol production processes that use a variety of feedstocks could foster increased diversity in agricultural landscapes and enhance arthropod-mediated ecosystem services.

AB  - Biomass harvest may eventually be conducted on over 100 000 000 ha of US crop and forest lands to meet federally-mandated targets for renewable biofuels. Such large-scale land use changes could profoundly impact working landscapes and the arthropod communities that inhabit them. We review the literature on dedicated biofuel crops and biomass harvest from forests to look for commonalities in arthropod community responses. With expanded biofuel production, existing arthropod pests of biofuel crops will likely become more important and new pests will emerge. Beneficial arthropods will also be influenced by biofuel crop habitats, potentially altering the distribution of pollination and pest control services to the surrounding landscape. Production of biofuel crops including initial crop selection, genetic improvement, agronomic practices, and harvest regimes will also influence arthropod communities. In turn, arthropods will impact the productivity and species composition of biomass production systems. Some of these processes have the potential to cause landscape-level changes in arthropod community dynamics and insect-vectored plant diseases. Finally, changes in arthropod populations and their spatiotemporal distribution in the landscape will have impacts on consumers of insects at higher trophic levels, potentially influencing their population and community dynamics and producing feedbacks to arthropod communities. Given that dedicated biofuel crops and intensified biomass harvest from forests are still relatively uncommon in North America, as they increase, we anticipate 'predictably unpredictable' shifts in arthropod communities and the ecosystem services and functions they support. We suggest that research on arthropod dynamics within biofuel crops, their spillover into adjacent habitats, and implications for the sustainability of working landscapes are critical topics for both basic and applied investigations.

AB  - The amino sugars (e.g., glucosamine, galactosamine, mannosamine, muramic acid) in soils are frequently employed as biomarkers of microbial residues. The analysis of amino sugars in environmental matrices, however, is expected to be more complicated than their determination in isolated microbial cells. In this study, we employed a widely used protocol for amino sugar analysis, and found that some aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with amino sugar quantification in vitro. The method converts the aminoglycosides to compounds that coelute with the aldononitrile acetate derivatives of the amino sugars. Specifically, streptomycin significantly interferes with muramic acid analysis, and kanamycin, tobramycin and amikacin hamper glucosamine measurement. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the interfering compounds from aminoglycosides are not actually genuine microbial amino sugar monomers (bacterial muramic acid or fungal glucosamine), and are most likely to be N-methyl glucosamine or 3-amino-3-deoxy-glucopyranose. In contrast to their effects on muramic acid and glucosamine analyses, aminoglycosides do not interfere with galactosamine and mannosamine quantification. The few data that exist on the environmental occurrence of aminoglycoside antibiotics suggest they occur at only trace levels. Our findings may have implications for the qualitative and quantitative validity of results from amino sugar assays in some context. Application of the aldononitrile acetate derivatization method to samples (especially in selective microbial cultures using aminoglycosides as inhibitors) requires that potential interference be evaluated.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is central to living systems, and its addition to agricultural cropping systems is an essential facet of modern crop management and one of the major reasons that crop production has kept pace with human population growth. The benefits of N added to cropping systems come, however, at well-documented environmental costs: Increased coastal hypoxia, atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), reactive N gases in the troposphere, and N deposition onto forests and other natural areas are some of the consequences of our inability to keep fertilizer N from leaving cropped ecosystems via unmanaged pathways. The N cycle is complex, and solutions require a thorough understanding of both the biogeochemical pathways of N in agricultural systems and the consequences of different management practices. Despite the complexity of this challenge, however, a number of technologies are available today to reduce N loss. These include adding rotational complexity to cropping systems to improve N capture by crops, providing farmers with decision support tools for better predicting crop fertilizer N requirements, improving methods for optimizing fertilizer timing and placement, and developing watershed-level strategies to recapture N lost from fields. Solutions to the problem of agricultural N loss will require a portfolio approach in which different technologies are used in different combinations to address site-specific challenges. Solutions will also require incentives that promote their adoption.

AB  - Limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations to low levels requires strategies to manage anthropogenic carbon emissions from terrestrial systems as well as fossil fuel and industrial sources. We explore the implications of fully integrating terrestrial systems and the energy system into a comprehensive mitigation regime that limits atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that this comprehensive approach lowers the cost of meeting environmental goals but also carries with it profound implications for agriculture: Unmanaged ecosystems and forests expand, and food crop and livestock prices rise. Finally, we find that future improvement in food crop productivity directly affects land-use change emissions, making the technology for growing crops potentially important for limiting atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
