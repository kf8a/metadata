Hello GLBRC Sustainability Investigators,

You are invited to the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center Sustainability Data Catalog (http://data.sustainability.glbrc.org).  The catalog is a collection of the data from the GLBRC sustainability research sites in Michigan and Wisconsin and summarizes each available data set.  Only GLBRC researchers are given full access to data, which requires password-access. Others may request access via a procedure explained on the catalog web site.

Please note that permission to download does not provide permission to publish.  Use of any data from the GLBRC Sustainability Data Catalog in a public presentation or publication requires written permission from the lead investigators (listed with each data table). This is mainly to protect first rights to publish and applies to users both internal and external to the Center. Our full data access policy appears on the web site.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements to the data catalog.


Best regards,
Sven Bohm
