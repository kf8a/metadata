8	Ayres, M. P., and J. M. Scriber. 1994. Local adaptations to regional climates in Papillo Canadensis Lepidoptera: Papollionidae. Ecological Monographs 64: 465-482. 	Papilio canadensis encounters shorter, cooler summers in interior Alaska than in northern Michigan: average thermal sums are 583 vs. 985 Celsius degree-days (10&deg;C base); mean daily temperature is 14.4 vs. 18.8&deg;. The temperature physiology of P. canadensis could be evolutionarily conserved, or the species may be a composite of regionally adapted populations. We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing the developmental physiology of P. canadensis from Alaska and Michigan across a range of temperatures in the laboratory and field. Higher temperatures generally resulted in more rapid larval development, but the effects varied with insect population and host. At low temperatures (12&deg;), Alaskan larvae grew faster than Michigan larvae (fifth instars doubled their fresh mass in 5.8 vs. 9.1 d), primarily due to 40% higher consumption rates. At high temperatures (30&deg;), Alaskan larvae grew slower, faster, or the same as Michigan larvae, depending upon host. Effects of host quality were greatest at high temperatures. Elevated respiratory expenses in Alaskan larvae (35% higher than Michigan larvae) made them especially sensitive to host quality at high temperatures. Dry matter digestibility and nitrogen use efficiency differed across hosts, but not between populations or across temperatures. Molting accounted for 35-51% of development time. Alaskan larvae completed their fifth molt faster than Michigan larvae at 12&deg; (11.8 vs. 17.8 d), but not at 30&deg; (3.1 vs. 2.9 d). In both populations, molt was more temperature sensitive than growth at low temperatures (Q10 of 5.65 vs. 3.04 from 12 to 18&deg;), but less temperature sensitive at high temperatures (Q10 of 1.60 vs. 2.06 from 18 to 30&deg;). Survival differed across temperatures, but not between populations. Under ideal basking conditions, larvae in the field were able to elevate body temperatures &asymp;10&deg; above ambient, but such conditions were rare in Alaska and larvae were usually near ambient temperature. Alaskan larvae were no better than Michigan larvae at selecting high radiation microsites or converting solar radiation into heat. Growth rates of Alaskan larvae were the same in the field and laboratory when fed the same foliage and exposed to the same mean daily air temperature. We incorporated P. canadensis temperature responses into a life history development model, then used a 48-yr climatic record to evaluate the fitness contributions of apparent adaptations to Alaskan summers. On a good host, at Alaskan temperatures, Alaskan P. canadensis had an estimated fitness 3.0 times greater than Michigan P. canadensis. Furthermore, the Michigan population was predicted to go extinct in 31 of 48 yr at Alaskan temperatures. Changes in growth temperature responses made the greatest contribution to enhanced fitness in Alaska, followed by increased mass of neonates, enhanced molting abilities at low temperatures, and a reduced size threshold for pupation. Analysis of fitness trade-offs suggested that extreme summers have been more important than average summers in shaping adaptive responses. Regional adaptation to climate allows P. canadensis to maintain a broader geographic distribution than would otherwise be possible, but northern distribution limits are probably still constrained by summer temperatures. 	1	\N
12	Blackwood, C. B. 2003. Eubacterial community structure and population size within the soil light fraction, rhizosphere, and heavy fraction of several agricultural systems. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 35: 1245-1255. 	The hypothesis that soil light fraction and heavy fraction harbor distinct eubacterial communities and have differing numbers and sizes of bacterial cells was tested in three agronomic cropping systems. This hypothesis would imply that these soil fractions are distinct microbial habitats. Shoot residue and rhizosphere soil were also included in the analysis. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S ribosomal DNA was used to assay eubacterial community structure. T-RFLP profiles were affected by both soil fraction and cropping system, accounting for 35&ndash;50% of the variance in the profiles. T-RFLP profiles separated samples into two distinct eubacterial habitats: soil heavy fraction, which includes the mineral particles and associated humified organic matter, and soil light fraction/shoot residue and rhizosphere, which includes particulate soil organic matter. Differences were not based on organic C content of fractions alone; T-RFLP profiles were also differentiated by cropping system and by rhizosphere versus light fraction/shoot residue. Heavy fraction communities had the least amount of random variability in T-RFLP profiles, resulting in the clearest cropping system effects, while rhizosphere and shoot residue communities were the most variable. Profiles from organically managed corn soil were more variable than for either conventionally managed corn or alfalfa. The log number of bacterial cells per gram fraction was affected by soil fraction but not cropping system, being highest in the light fraction. The percentage of cells &gt;0.18 &mu;m3 was also greater in the light fraction than in other fractions. While bacterial cell density was generally correlated with C content of the soil fraction, heavy fraction did have a significantly greater number of cells per &mu;g C than other soil fractions. The results show that habitat diversity in soil, related both to the amounts and types of organic matter, as well as other potential factors, are important in maintaining the high soil bacterial species diversity and evenness that is found in soil. 	1	\N
16	Broughton, L. C., and K. L. Gross. 2000. Patterns of diversity in plant and soil microbial communities along a productivity gradient in a Michigan old field. Oecologia 125: 420-427. 	The relationship between plant diversity and productivity has received much attention in ecology, but the relationship of these factors to soil microbial communities has been little explored. The carbon resources that support soil microbial communities are primarily derived from plants, so it is likely that the soil microbial community should respond to changes in plant diversity or productivity, particularly if the plant community affects the quality or quantity of available carbon. We investigated the relationship of plant diversity and productivity to the composition of the soil microbial community along a topographic gradient in a mid-successional old-field in southwestern Michigan. Soil moisture, soil inorganic N, and plant biomass increased from the top to the base of the slope, while light at ground level decreased along this same gradient. We characterized the changes in resource levels along this gradient using an index of productivity that incorporated light levels, soil N, soil moisture, and plant biomass. Average plant species richness declined with this productivity index and there were associated compositional changes in the plant community along the gradient. The plant community shifted from predominantly low-growing perennial forbs at low productivities to perennial grasses at higher productivities. Although there was variation in the structure of the soil microbial community [as indicated by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles], changes in the composition of the soil microbial community were not correlated with plant productivity or diversity. However, microbial activity [as indicated by Biolog average well color development and substrate-induced respiration (SIR)] was positively correlated with plant productivity. The similarity between patterns of plant biomass and soil microbial activity suggests that either plant productivity is driving microbial productivity or that limiting resources for each of these two communities co-vary. 	1	\N

Basic and Applied Ecology 5: 337-355. 	Several. studies have shown positive responses of parasitism to either host density or landscape complexity. However, no experiments have manipulated host density in landscapes of differing complexity. Here we report the results of a field experiment conducted to determine how host density and agricultural landscape structure jointly affect parasitism and parasitoid diversity of Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Parasitism was assessed by experimentally adding P unipuncta sentinel. larvae at low (1 larvae/plant) and high (3 tarvae/ptant) densities to detect parasitism in commercial cornfields located in a complex and a simple agricultural landscape. The braconid wasps Glyptapanteles militaris (Walsh) and Meteorus spp. accounted for 98.4% of the observed parasitism. Landscape structure did not influence parasitism (80.2% on average) and contrary to expectations, showed a trend towards increased parasitoid richness and diversity in the simple landscape. Increasing host density revealed a trend of increasing parasitoid richness and diversity, and differentially affected parasitism at the parasitoid specific level. G. militaris parasitized a significantly greater proportion of hosts at low host density, while the opposite occurred for Meteorus spp. (primarily M. communis). These offsetting responses of parasitoids resulted in the tack of an overall host density effect on parasitism. The differential response of these parasitoids to host density is discussed in relation to differences in morphological and life history characteristics. Our results suggest that the specific composition of parasitoid assemblages could significantly alter parasitism at different host densities independently of landscape structural complexity.

38	Davis, A. S., K. Renner, and K. L. Gross. 2005. Weed seedbank and community shifts in a long-term cropping systems experiment. Weed Science 53: 296-306. 	Characterizing the long-term effect of agricultural management systems on weed communities will aid in developing sustainable weed management practices. Weed seedbanks and aboveground biomass were measured within a corn-soybean-wheat crop sequence from 1990 through 2002 at Hickory Corners, MI. Four management systems were compared: conventional (CONV; full rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage), no till (NT; same as CONV with no primary tillage), reduced input (RI; reduced rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage, mechanical weed control, wheat underseeded with red clover), and organic (ORG; same as RI but no synthetic inputs). Multivariate ordinations of weed seedbanks showed a divergence of the CONV and NT systems from the RI and ORG systems. The CONV and NT seedbanks were dominated by grass species (mainly fall panicum and large crabgrass), whereas the RI and ORG systems were dominated by common lambsquarters and common chickweed. Within a single growing season, weed seedbanks in the RI and ORG systems were positively correlated with weed biomass whereas seedbanks in the CONV and NT system had little predictive value. Weed biomass from 1990 through 2002 showed a strong association of grass weed species with the corn phase of the CONV and NT system and common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed with the corn and soybean phases of the RI and ORG systems. Weed biomass diversity measures were negatively correlated with soybean yields in RI and ORG and wheat yields in NT, RI, and ORG. It is not clear whether crops were less competitive in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments, allowing new weed species to enter the plots, or whether less effective weed management in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments resulted in increased species richness, causing reduced crop yields. Mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between weed community diversity and crop performance.	1	\N

Soil Biology and Biochemistry 35: 1005-1013. 	The uniformity, low cost and ease of application associated with inorganic fertilizers have diminished the use of organic nutrient sources. Concern for food safety, the environment and the need to dispose of animal and municipal wastes have focused attention on organic sources of N such as animal-derived amendments, green manures, and crop rotations. Managing organic N sources to provide sufficient N for crop growth requires knowledge of C and N decomposition over several years, particularly where manure and compost are applied. We report a comparison of compost and chemical fertilizer, use of a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation compared to continuous corn and the use of cover crops. Nitrogen (150d) and C incubations (317 d) were conducted to determine the effect of cropping system and nutrient management on: N mineralization potential (NMP), the mineralizable organic N pool (N.), the mean residence time (MRT) of No, C mineralization (C-min), and soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and fluxes. Compost applications over 6 y increased the resistant pool of C by 30% and the slow pool of C by 10%. The compost treatment contained 14% greater soil organic C than the fertilizer management. Nitrogen was limiting on all compost treatments with the exception of first year corn following wheat fallow and clover cover crop. The clover cover crop and wheat-fallow increased inorganic N in both nutrient managements. We recommend that growers adjust their N fertilizer recommendation to reflect the quantity and timing of N mineralized from organic N sources and the N immobilization that can be associated with compost or other residue applications. Proper management of nutrients from compost, cover crops and rotations can maintain soil fertility and increase C sequestration. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. 	1	\N

Thermodynamic constraints on nitrogen transformation and other biogeochemical processes at soil-stream interfaces. Ecology 79: 684-703.	There is much interest in biogeochemical processes that occur at the interface between soils and streams since, at the scale of landscapes, these habitats may function as control points for fluxes of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Here we examine whether a thermodynamic perspective can enhance our mechanistic and predictive understanding of the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces, by considering how microbial communities interact with variations in supplies of electron donors and accepters. Over a two-year period we analyzed &gt;1400 individual samples of subsurface waters from networks of sample wells in riparian wetlands along Smith Creek, a first-order stream draining a mixed forested-agricultural landscape in southwestern Michigan, USA. We focused on areas where soil water and ground water emerged into the stream, and where we could characterize subsurface flow paths by measures of hydraulic head and/or by in situ additions of hydrologic tracers. We found strong support for the idea that the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces is a predictable outcome of the interaction between microbial communities and supplies of electron donors and accepters. Variations in key electron donors and accepters (NO3-, N2O, NH4+, SO42-, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) closely followed predictions from thermodynamic theory. Transformations of N and other elements resulted from the response of microbial communities to two dominant hydrologic flow paths: (1) horizontal flow of shallow subsurface waters with high levels of electron donors (i.e., DOG, CH4, and NH4+), and (2) near-stream vertical upwelling of deep subsurface waters with high levels of energetically favorable electron accepters (i.e., NO3-, N2O, and SO42-). Our results support the popular notion that soil-stream interfaces can possess strong potential for removing dissolved N by denitrification. Yet in contrast to prevailing ideas, we found that denitrification did not consume all NO3- that reached the soil-stream interface via subsurface flow paths. Analyses of subsurface N chemistry and natural abundances of delta(15)N in NO3- and NH4+ suggested a narrow near-stream region as functionally the most important location for NO3- consumption by denitrification. This region was characterized by high throughput of terrestrially derived water, by accumulation of dissolved NO3- and N2O, and by low levels of DOG. Field experiments supported our hypothesis that the sustained ability for removal of dissolved NO3- and N2O should be limited by supplies of oxidizable carbon via shallow flowpaths. In situ additions of acetate, succinate, and propionate induced rates of NO3- removal (similar to 1.8 g N.m(-2).d(-1)) that were orders of magnitude greater than typically reported from riparian habitats. We propose that the immediate near-stream region may be especially important for determining the landscape-level function of many riparian wetlands, Management efforts to optimize the removal of NO3- by denitrification ought to consider promoting natural inputs of oxidizable carbon to this near-stream region. 	1	\N

Root system changes in response to experimental treatments may he due to a number of factors, which can be separated only by sampling roots of known age. Minirhizotrons allow for video recording of the growth of individual roots; subsequent removal of the minirhizotron would allow sampling of the roots under observation. A design for a removable minirhizotron with mechanically expandable walls is described in this paper, along with the use of laparascopic tools for sampling roofs from removable minirhizotron systems. Laparascopic tools used in conjunction with removable minirhizotrons may be useful in field studies of the effects of root age and experimental treatments on root composition, physiology, and pathology; rhizosphere mycrobial ecology; rhizosphere mineralogy; and the dynamics of mycorrhizal colonization.	1	\N

Ecological observations on habitat utilization by thirteen species of predatory Coccinellidae were made at a southern Michigan site during 1989 and 1990. Most of species were common during both years and used both agricultural and uncultivated habitats. Coccinella septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata, were the most abundant in agricultural crops (alfalfa, maize, soybean and triticale), whereas Adalia bipunctata and Cycloneda munda, were the most abundant in deciduous and bushy habitats. 	1	\N

Rosenberg, and C. Rosenzweig. 2003. U.S. agriculture and climate change: New results. Climatic Change 57: 43-69. 	We examined the impacts on U.S. agriculture of transient climate change as simulated by 2 global general circulation models focusing on the decades of the 2030s and 2090s. We examined historical shifts in the location of crops and trends in the variability of U.S. average crop yields, finding that non-climatic forces have likely dominated the north and westward movement of crops and the trends in yield variability. For the simulated future climates we considered impacts on crops, grazing and pasture, livestock, pesticide use, irrigation water supply and demand, and the sensitivity to international trade assumptions, finding that the aggregate of these effects were positive for the U.S. consumer but negative, due to declining crop prices, for producers. We examined the effects of potential changes in El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and impacts on yield variability of changes in mean climate conditions. Increased losses occurred with ENSO intensity and frequency increases that could not be completely offset even if the events could be perfectly forecasted. Effects on yield variability of changes in mean temperatures were mixed. We also considered case study interactions of climate, agriculture, and the environment focusing on climate effects on nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay and groundwater depletion of the Edward's Aquifer that provides water for municipalities and agriculture to the San Antonio, Texas area. While only case studies, these results suggest environmental targets such as pumping limits and changes in farm practices to limit nutrient run-off Would need to be tightened if current environmental goals were to be achieved under the climate scenarios we examined. 	1	\N
160	Robertson, G. P., and D. W. Freckman. 1995. The spatial distribution of nematode trophic groups across a cultivated ecosystem. Ecology 76: 1425-1432.	In order to better understand the spatial distributions of soil trophic groups and the potential significance of these distributions to ecosystem functioning we initiated a study to-describe the within-site variability of nematode feeding groups in a row-crop ecosystem. Soil cores were removed from a 48-ha corn (Zea mays) held in the U.S. Midwest prior to spring planting, and nematodes were identified by phenotypic criteria to four groups: bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores/predators, and plant parasites. Within-site variability was high for all groups; population counts spanned two orders of magnitude, with coefficients of variation ranging from 40-130% (n = 115-138 soil samples). Probability distributions were strongly lognormal. Geostatistical analysis showed that a major part of this variability was spatially dependent; variograms suggest that 70-99% of sample population variance was related to spatial autocorrelation over our geographic range of 6-80 m, except for the parasitic group, for which we detected no autocorrelation to 1200 m. Maps of nonparasitic feeding groups across the field showed large multi-hectare areas of low to moderate population densities, with sub-hectare clusters of high-density populations towards one end of the site. Individual feeding groups were only weakly correlated with one another across the held (Kendall's tau less than or equal to 0.363, P &lt; 0.001). Edaphic factors (bulk density, texture, pH, C availability, N availability) could collectively explain &lt;30% of the variability in the nonparasitic groups across the area sampled.  Results suggest that important soil food web components are strongly patterned at subhectare scales in this site. That this patterning is maintained in an ecosystem subjected to the homogenizing influences of annual soil tillage and a monoculture plant population is remarkable, and suggests that such patterning may be even more common in less-disturbed sites. Inclusion of these patterns in studies of ecosystem processes and soil community dynamics may significantly improve soil trophic models and our understanding of the relationship between soil populations and ecosystem function. 	1	\N

The discovery of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, in U.S. soybean production systems in 2000 has provided a unique opportunity to study the interaction of a new invader with existing natural enemy communities. One research thrust has been examining the role of predators in soybean aphid dynamics in the Midwest. We discuss the roles of predatory arthropods in field crops and set forth a conceptual model that we have followed to identify key predators in the soybean aphid system. We identify Orius insidiosus (Say) and Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) as potentially key predators and show our findings on their phenology in soybean fields and their impact on soybean aphid population dynamics. Finally, we discuss how this information can be used in integrated pest management programs for soybean aphid and point to gaps in our knowledge where future studies are needed. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society America Journal 61: 720-724.	It is well accepted that soil organic matter improves soil structure; however, current methods limit our knowledge of the many physical-chemical mechanisms that control the temporal processes of soil aggregation. A soil aggregate erosion (SAE) apparatus was designed to uniformly remove concentric surface layers of soil aggregates in an enclosed erosion chamber. The SAE was used to test for the presence of concentration gradients within aggregates of different soil types. The SAE method generally improved the separation of ion concentrations between the external and internal layers. Concentrations of C, Ca, and Mg were 8 to 19, 20 to 21, and 29 to 33% lower, respectively, at the external layers of aggregates for Haplaquoll and Hapludalf soils. Removal of surface layers had no effect on the tensile strength of soil aggregates. Therefore, we concluded that the SAE apparatus improves the separation of ion gradients within natural soil aggregates. Identification of the mineralogical, physical, chemical, and biological properties of this improved separation of concentric layers from soil aggregates should lead to further advancements in our knowledge of the functional mechanisms associated with the development and stability of soil aggregates. 	1	\N

We describe a Functional Modeling approach for understanding biological systems and using that understanding for consequence finding. In our Functional Approach, abstractly stated system goals (functions) are used to organize (index) causal understanding about the system. A functional representation of a system then provides the framework for performing a type of qualitative reasoning aimed at determining consequences on the system given particular boundary conditions. As an example of a complex biological system, we exhibit our initial results in applying our approach to an ecological problem, modeling the West-African nitrogen cycle. We show that our approach provides leverage for handling the complexity, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge inherent in the domain. 	1	\N
195	Suding, K. N., K. L. Gross, and G. Houseman. 2004. Alternative states and positive feedbacks in restoration ecology. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 19: 46-53. 	There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints. 	1	\N
1	Ka, J. O. and J. M. Tiedje. 1994. Integration and excision of a 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetate acid-degradative plasmid in alcaligenes paradoxus and evidence of its natural intergeneric transfer. Journal Bacteriology 176: 5284-5289.	A self-transmissible 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degradative plasmid, pKA2, has been identified in a new 2,4-D-degrading strain, Alcaligenes paradoxus 2811P, isolated from agricultural soil. pKA2 occurred as a 42.9-kb plasmid in strain 2811P. A derivative strain, 2811C, was isolated from a stock culture in which the entire pKA2 plasmid was apparently integrated into the host chromosome without loss of the 2,4-D phenotype. This interpretation is based on the disappearance of a free plasmid DNA band, a shift in the tfdA-hybridizing band to the chromosome, loss of transmissibility of the 2,4-D+ trait, and appropriate shifts in Southern hybridization bands of plasmid DNA compared with whole-cell DNA. The integrated plasmid of strain 2811C was excised either precisely or imprecisely after continued transfer on 2,4-D-containing medium. This suggests that a chromosome-free plasmid cycle may occur to optimize fitness under conditions of specific resource fluctuation. Another new 2,4-D-degrading strain, Pseudomonas pickettii 712, which was isolated from the same field plot but at a different time, was found to carry a plasmid that is nearly identical to pKA2. The plasmid of this strain, pKA4, is 40.9 kb long and has features in common with pKA2, such as high self-transmissibility, hybridization only to the tfdA gene among the 2,4-D-metabolic genes of 2,4-D-degradative plasmid pJP4, and similar restriction endonuclease-generated fragments. Furthermore, the genetic homology between the two plasmids was high since all fragments of pKA2 hybridized to pKA4. These results suggest that these two plasmids are closely related and thus their occurrence in two genera in nature is the result of natural horizontal gene transfer. 	1	\N

Agriculture, Ecosystems, and  Environment 109: 97-106.	Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) contributes 430 million kg N year(-1) to the US Corn-Belt soils, according to a 1991 survey. Minimizing leaching losses from these very large N inputs requires a better understanding of the specific root dynamics that relate to the shoot-borne nitrates which have been reported to develop throughout many soil profiles. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of decaying alfalfa roots on nitrate inputs to soils and on soil hydraulic conductivity properties which affect nitrate leaching.  An experiment was initiated in 1994 and data for this report were taken from research on a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) at the KBS/LTER (long-term ecological research) site in southwestern Michigan, during the period from 1996 through 1997. Soil extractable nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) were monitored to soil depths of 150 cm and soil soluble NO3-N and NH4-N were monitored by suction lysimeters to the depth of 65 cm. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of soil was measured by the double-ring infiltrometer method. Following glyphosate termination of the alfalfa stands, nitrate-N released from mineralized alfalfa roots plus shoots totaled 75 kg ha(-1). Alfalfa roots generated 36 kg ha(-1) and alfalfa shoots generated 39 kg ha(-1) which accumulated in the Ap horizons from April to July in 1997. The presence of decaying alfalfa roots in the profile quadrupled Ksat values as compared to bare fallow soils. Nitrates released from decomposing alfalfa roots combined with root-enhanced hydraulic conductivities dramatically increased NO3-N leaching following the termination of alfalfa stands. NO3-N leaching to deeper horizons approached 83 kg ha(-1) in root treatments and 144 kg ha(-1) in the root plus shoot treatments during the period from April to December, following alfalfa termination. Our data suggest that under temperate climate such as that of Michigan, groundwater contamination by nitrates can be reduced by terminating alfalfa stands immediately before spring-planting of the subsequent row crop, which can absorb the large quantities of N leaking from decomposing shoots and roots of the legume.

The beneficial plant growth-promoting association of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii with rice roots. Australian Journal of Plant Physiology 28: 845-870. 	This paper summarizes a multinational collaborative project to search for natural, intimate associations between rhizobia and rice (Oryza sativa L.), assess their impact on plant growth, and exploit those combinations that can enhance grain yield with less dependence on inputs of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Diverse, indigenous populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii (the clover root-nodule endosymbiont) intimately colonize rice roots in the Egyptian Nile delta where this cereal has been rotated successfully with berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) since antiquity. Laboratory and greenhouse studies have shown with certain rhizobial strain-rice variety combinations that the association promotes root and shoot growth thereby significantly improving seedling vigour that carries over to significant increases in grain yield at maturity. Three field inoculation trials in the Nile delta indicated that a few strain-variety combinations significantly increased rice grain yield, agronomic fertilizer N-use efficiency and harvest index. The benefits of this association leading to greater production of vegetative and reproductive biomass more likely involve rhizobial modulation of the plant's root architecture for more efficient acquisition of certain soil nutrients [e.g. N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na) and molybdenum (Mo)] rather than biological N-2 fixation. Inoculation increased total protein quantity per hectare in field-grown grain, thereby increasing its nutritional value without altering the ratios of nutritionally important proteins. Studies using a selected rhizobial strain (E11) indicated that it produced auxin (indoleacetic acid) and gibberellin [tentatively identified as gibberellin (GA(7))] phytohormones representing two major classes of plant growth regulators. Axenically collected rice root exudate significantly enhanced E11's production of this auxin. This strain extensively colonized the rice root surface under gnotobiotic culture conditions, producing distributions of spatial patchiness that would favour their localized erosion of the epidermal surface, colonization of small crevices at epidermal junctions as a possible portal to enter into the root, and quorum sensing of diffusible signal molecules indicating that their nearest bacterial neighbours are in close proximity in situ. Studies of selected rhizobial endophytes of rice indicated that they produced cell-bound cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes that can hydrolyze glycosidic bonds in plant cell walls, and non-trifolitoxin bacteriocin(s) that can inhibit other strains of clover rhizobia. Strain E11 was able to endophytically colonize rice roots of varieties commonly used by Filipino peasant farmers, and also to stimulate genotype-specific growth-promotion of corn (Zea mays, maize) under field conditions. An amalgam of these results indicate some rhizobia have evolved an additional ecological niche enabling them to form a three-component life cycle including a free-living heterotrophic phase in soil, a N-2-fixing endosymbiont phase within legume root nodules, and a beneficial growth-promoting endocolonizer phase within cereal roots in the same crop rotation. Our results further indicate the potential opportunity to exploit this newly described, plant-rhizobia association by developing biofertilizer inoculants that may assist low-income farmers in increasing cereal production (especially rice) with less fertilizer N inputs, fully consistent with both sustainable agriculture and environmental safety. 	1	\N

Journal of Environmental Quality 29:298-304.	Nitrate leaching from maize (Zea naps L.,) fields fertilized in excess of plant requirements continue to threaten water quality even though many agronomists have recommended reducing N fertilization rates to contain this environmental risk, inbred maize has lower N uptake than conventional hybrid maize; therefore, inbred maize production exposes soils to even greater ground water pollution risks by nitrates. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted on sandy loam seas in southwestern Michigan to investigate the combined effects of N fertilization rates and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops on NO3 leaching in inbred maize fields, Inbred maize was fertilized at 0, 101, and 202 kg N ha(-1). Annual NO3 leaching losses were 7 kg N ha(-1) higher in fields fertilized at 101 ks N ha(-1) than in nonfertilized controls. Annual NO3 leaching losses to ground water between May 1995 and April 1998 from lysimeters fertilized at 202 kg N ha(-1) averaged 88 kg NO3-N ha(-1). Rye interseeded with inbred maize fertilized at 202 kg N ha(-1) sequestered from 46 to 56 kg ha(-1) of excess fertilizer N, Rye scavenged little residual fertilizer N in plots fertilized at 101 kg N ha(-1). Well established rye cover crops in 1996 reduced NO3 leaching by as much as 65 kg N ha(-1) when the previous crop was fertilized with 202 kg N ha(-1). Therefore, rye cover crops sequestered substantial amounts of soil NO3 in heavily fertilized inbred maize fields. 	1	\N

New evidence confirms earlier postulates that root signals to shoots, including abscisic acid, nitrate flux, and cytokinins, modify whole plant growth processes including leaf expansion, stomatal behavior, and biosynthesis of photosynthetic enzymes. Root signals are thought to reflect soil water, nutrient, and mechanical attributes, as sensed by roots. Meristematic activities in root tips initiate changes in root architecture, modifying the soil volume subject to root uptake, and may provide multiple sensory and signaling capabilities. Knowledge of root signals regulating whole plant growth processes suggests new analytical and experimental tools for integrated analysis of plant phasic development, optimal growth, and ecological fitness. 	1	\N

Elevated atmospheric CO2 has the potential to change below-ground nutrient cycling and thereby alter the soil-atmosphere exchange of biogenic trace gases.  We measured fluxes of CH4 and N2O in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands grown in open-top chambers under ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations crossed with 'high' and low soil-N conditions. Flux measurements with small static chambers indicated net CH4 oxidation in the open-top chambers.  Across dates, CH4 oxidation activity was significantly (P &lt;0.05) greater with ambient CO2 (8.7 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) than with elevated CO2 (6.5 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) in the low N soil.  Likewise, across dates and soil N treatments CH4 was oxidized more rapidly (P &lt;0.05) in chambers with ambient CO2 (9.5 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1) than in chambers with elevated CO2 (8.8 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1).  Methane oxidation in soils incubated in serum bottles did not show any response to the CO2 treatment.  We suggest that the depressed CH4 oxidation under elevated CO2 in the field chambers is due to soil moisture which tended to be higher in the twice-ambient CO2 treatment than in the ambient CO2 treatment. Phase I denitrification (denitrification enzyme activity) was 12 - 26% greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in the 'high' N soil; one sampling, however, showed a 39% lower enzyme activity with elevated CO2.  In both soil N treatments, denitrification potentials measured after 24 to 48 h were between 11% and 21% greater (P &lt;0.05) with twice-ambient CO2 than with ambient CO2.  Fluxes of N2O in the open-top chambers and in separate 44 cm2 cores &plusmn; N fertilization were not affected by CO2 treatment and soil N status. Our data show that elevated atmospheric CO2 may have a negative effect on terrestrial CH4 oxidation.  the data also indicated temporary greater denitrification with elevated CO2 than with ambient CO2.  In contrast, we found no evidence for altered fluxes of N2O in response to increases in atmospheric CO2. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 62:394-400. 	Trace gas fluxes often show temporal variability on the order of hours and accurate quantification may be difficult without continuous or near-continuous measurements. We developed an automated near-continuous trace gas analysis system (NCTGAS) to measure soil-atmosphere gas fluxes on a several-times-per-day basis. In this system, air is circulated in a closed sample loop between fully automated flow-through chambers and a photoacoustic infrared trace gas analyzer (TGA). The TGA quantifies infrared active gases at ambient levels within 2 to 3 min. We tested sensitivity, stability, and calibration of the TGA, and the ability of the NCTGAS to measure fluxes of CO2 and N2O. In addition to static tests, fluxes of CO2 and N2O were simulated by bleeding known quantities of these gases into a test chamber. Gas samples were simultaneously analyzed by TGA and removed for independent analysis of CO2 by conventional infrared gas analysis and for N2O by gas chromatography. The TGA-based flux measurements were statistically identical to the independent measurements of both CO2 and N2O. In situ fluxes of CO2 and N2O measured by the NCTGAS were 105 &plusmn; 6 and 93 &plusmn; 10%, respectively, of those measured from hand-drawn samples. The TGA was as or more stable than conventional means for measuring CO2 and N2O in air at ambient concentrations, and was equally sensitive across the range of concentrations normally encountered in field measurements. Fast response time and ease of use offers significant advantages over conventional gas chromatography. 	1	\N

Biogeochemistry 79:315-337	Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is anticipated to increase over the next decades with possible implications for future forest-atmosphere interactions. Increased soil N2O emissions, depressed CH4 uptake and depressed soil respiration CO2 loss is considered a likely response to increased N deposition. This study examined fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 over two growing seasons from soils in unmanaged forest and grassland communities on abandoned agricultural areas in Michigan. All sites were subject to simulated increased N-deposition in the range of 1&ndash;3 g N m&minus;2 annually. Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil N concentrations in coniferous and grassland sites were on the whole unaffected by the increased N-inputs. It is noteworthy though that N2O emissions increased three-fold in the coniferous sites in the first growing season in response to the low N treatment, although the response was barely significant (p&lt;0.06). In deciduous forests, we observed increased levels of soil mineral N during the second year of N fertilization, however N2O fluxes did not increase. Rates of methane oxidation were similar in all sites with no affect of field N application. Likewise, we did not observe any changes in soil CO2 efflux in response to N additions. The combination of tillage history and vegetation type was important for the trace gas fluxes, i.e. soil CO2 efflux was greater in successional grassland sites compared with the forested sites and CH4 uptake was reduced in post-tillage coniferous- and successional sites compared with the old-growth deciduous site. Our results indicate that short-term increased N availability influenced individual processes linked to trace gas turnover in the soil independently from the ecosystem N status. However, changes in whole system fluxes were not evident and were very likely mediated by competitive N uptake processes.	1	\N

We investigated the effects of recent moisture history on the relative production of N2O and N2 during denitrification in soil from cropped and successional ecosystems. The soils were pedogenically identical but had been managed differently for the past decade. Sieved soils were amended with nitrate, glucose, and water. Long-wet and short-wet incubations received 80 and 0%, respectively, of prescribed water 2 d before incubation and the rest just before incubation. The N2O and N2 production and N2O mole fraction (N2O/[N2O + N2]) were measured using acetylene inhibition. The N2 production and soil 15N enrichment were measured by 15N-gas evolution. The response of N2O mole fraction to moisture history differed by ecosystem. Mean N2O mole fraction in the successional system was about the same for long-wet and short-wet treatments (0.34 and 0.33, respectively). For the cropped system, however, the N2O mole fraction was 0.36 for the long-wet and 0.90 for the short-wet treatment. Thus, in the cropped system a much smaller proportion of end product was N2O if soil had been wet for 2 d. For N2 fluxes, the isotope method gave the same pattern (r = 0.92) but only about one-third the magnitude, suggesting that N2 derived from two distinct pools. Differences in response of N2O mole fraction for successional and cropped soils may be due to differences in microbial communities. Further knowledge of ecosystem differences with respect to N2O mole fraction and recent moisture history may improve modeled estimates of local and global N2O fluxes. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 63:1709-1716. 	Very sensitive measurements of N2 and N2O flux from soil are possible when gas evolved from 15N-labeled soil is analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.  This approach is useful for studying the fate of nitrogen fertilizer and for studying soil microbial processes contributing to the atmospheric increase of nitrous oxide, a radiatively active trace gas that can contribute to global warming and ozone depletion.  Most systems of equations that relate isotopic analysis to gas flux are sufficiently complex that certain limitations and potentials of the 15N approach may be overlooked.  We describe a graphical representation of labeled N-gas flux that illustrates the equations and encourages critical thinking regarding the implementation of related experiments.  This model is used to interpret underestimation that occurs if flux derives from multiple pools of differing enrichment.  A statistical derivation is presented for a previously published simulation of underestimation due to multiple pools.  The same equations are applied to field data to explore whether temporal variation in soil nitrate enrichment is likely to cause significant underestimation.  Two sampling strategies are proposed that may eliminate the assumption of pool uniformity, thereby eliminating a potential source of underestimation. 	1	\N

Environmental Science and Technology 35: 4307-4312. 	Our purpose was to measure simultaneous fluxes from soil of both N2O and N2 from the same plot in the field using the 15N-gas &quot;nonequilibrium&quot; technique (i.e., the &quot;Hauck&quot; technique) as used previously for N2. We accommodated analysis of N2O by modifying the head amplifier of our mass spectrometer. Our system accurately measured the 15N enrichments of labeled soil slurries for both N2 and N2O. In the field, we measured flux of N2 and N2O during soil denitrification from a 15N-labeled plot of winter wheat. Nine chamber incubations were conducted over 4 days. N2 flux ranged from below detection limit (&lt;0.022 g &middot; m-2 &middot;d-1) to 0.055 g &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1. N2O flux ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0027 g N2O-N &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1, with a detection limit of 1.0 &middot; 10-6 g N2O-N &middot; m-2 &middot; d-1. For N2O flux, the 15N-gas technique and gas chromatography technique agreed well (r = 0.98). The 15N enrichment of the soil mineral pool undergoing denitrification, measured nondestructively using the N2O data, dropped from about 0.82 to 0.72 atom fraction 15N over 4 days. Applying the 15N-gas nonequilibrium technique to N2O complements its use for 15N-N2 analysis when studying the relative production of N2O and N2 during denitrification. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 69: 926-932. 	Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a culture-independent method of obtaining a genetic fingerprint of the composition of a microbial community. Comparisons of the utility of different methods of (i) including peaks, (ii) computing the difference (or distance) between profiles, and (iii) performing statistical analysis were made by using replicated profiles of eubacterial communities. These samples included soil collected from three regions of the United States, soil fractions derived from three agronomic field treatments, soil samples taken from within one meter of each other in an alfalfa field, and replicate laboratory bioreactors. Cluster analysis by Ward's method and by the unweighted-pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) were compared. Ward's method was more effective at differentiating major groups within sets of profiles; UPGMA had a slightly reduced error rate in clustering of replicate profiles and was more sensitive to outliers. Most replicate profiles were clustered together when relative peak height or Hellinger-transformed peak height was used, in contrast to raw peak height. Redundancy analysis was more effective than cluster analysis at detecting differences between similar samples. Redundancy analysis using Hellinger distance was more sensitive than that using Euclidean distance between relative peak height profiles. Analysis of Jaccard distance between profiles, which considers only the presence or absence of a terminal restriction fragment, was the most sensitive in redundancy analysis, and was equally sensitive in cluster analysis, if all profiles had cumulative peak heights greater than 10,000 fluorescence units. It is concluded that T-RFLP is a sensitive method of differentiating between microbial communities when the optimal statistical method is used for the situation at hand. It is recommended that hypothesis testing be performed by redundancy analysis of Hellinger-transformed data and that exploratory data analysis be performed by cluster analysis using Ward's method to find natural groups or by UPGMA to identify potential outliers. Analyses can also be based on Jaccard distance if all profiles have cumulative peak heights greater than 10,000 fluorescence units. 	1	\N

Soil Biology and Biochemistry 38: 720-728. 	The effects of enriched CO2 atmosphere on partitioning of recently assimilated carbon were investigated in a plant-soil-microorganism system in which Lolium perenne seedlings were planted into cores inserted into the resident soil within a sward that had been treated with elevated CO2 for 9 consecutive years, under two N fertilisation levels (Swiss FACE experiment). The planted cores were excavated from the ambient (35 Pa pCO2) and enriched (60 Pa pCO2) rings at two dates, in spring and autumn, during the growing season. The cores were brought back to the laboratory for 14C labelling of shoots in order to trace the transfer of recently assimilated C both within the plant and to the soil and microbial biomass. At the spring sampling, high N supply stimulated shoot and total dry matter production. Consistently, high N enhanced the allocation of recently fixed C to shoots, and reduced it to belowground compartments. Elevated CO2 had no consequences for DM or the pattern of C allocation. At the autumn sampling, at high N plot, yield of L. perenne was stimulated by elevated CO2. Consistently, 14C was preferentially allocated aboveground and, consequently belowground recent C allocation was depressed and rhizodeposition reduced. At both experimental periods, total soil C content was similar in all treatments, providing no evidence for soil carbon sequestration in the Swiss Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment (FACE) after 9 years of enrichment. Recently assimilated C and soil C were mineralised faster in soils from enriched rings, suggesting a CO2-induced shift in the microbial biomass characteristics (structure, diversity, activity) and/or in the quality of the root-released organic compounds. 	1	\N

Evolution 49: 1163-1171. 	Differential selection in a heterogeneous environment is thought to promote the maintenance of ecologically significant genetic variations.  Variation is maintained when selection is counterbalanced by the homogenizing effects of gene flow and random mating.  In this study, we examine the relative importance of differential selection and gene glow in maintaining genetic variation in Papilio glaucus.  differential selection on traits contributing to successful use of host plants (oviposition preference and larval performance) was assessed by comparing the responses of southern Ohio, north central Georgia, and southern Florida populations of P. glaucus to three hosts: Liriodendron tulipifera, Magnolia virginiana, and Prunus serotina.  Gene flow among populations was estimated using allozyme frequencies from nine polymorphic loci.  Significant genetic differentiation was observed among populations for both oviposition preference and larval performance.  This differentiation was interpreted to be the result of selection acting on Florida P. glaucus for enhanced use of Magnolia, the prevalent host in Florida.  In contrast, no evidence of population strengths of gene flow and genetic drift, was large, indicating that genetic exchange among P. glaucus populations is relatively unrestricted.  The contrasting patterns of spatial differentiation for host-use traits and lack of differentiation for electrophoretically detectable variation implies that differential selection among populations will be counterbalanced by gene flow, thereby maintaining genetic variation for host-use traits. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 65: 2994-3000.	Autotrophic ammonia oxidizer (AAO) populations in soils from native, tilled, and successional treatments at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research site in southwestern Michigan were compared to assess effects of disturbance on these bacteria. N fertilization effects on AAO populations were also evaluated with soils from fertilized microplots within the successional treatments. Population structures were characterized by PCR amplification of microbial community DNA with group-specific 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) primers, cloning of PCR products and clone hybridizations with group-specific probes, phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rDNA sequences, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Population sizes were estimated by using most-probable-number (MPN) media containing varied concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Tilled soils contained higher numbers than did native soils of culturable AAOs that were less sensitive to different ammonium concentrations in MPN media. Compared to sequences from native soils, partial 16S rDNA sequences from tilled soils were less diverse and grouped exclusively within Nitrosospira cluster 3. Native soils yielded sequences representing three different AAO clusters. Probes for Nitrosospira cluster 3 hybridized with DGGE blots from tilled and fertilized successional soils but not with blots from native or unfertilized successional soils. Hybridization results thus suggested a positive association between the Nitrosospira cluster 3 subgroup and soils amended with inorganic N. DGGE patterns for soils sampled from replicated plots of each treatment were nearly identical for tilled and native soils in both sampling years, indicating spatial and temporal reproducibility based on treatment. 	1	\N

The biochemical pathway and genetics of autotrophic ammonia oxidation have been studied almost exclusively in Nitrosomonas europaea. Terrestrial autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOs), however, comprise two distinct phylogenetic groups in the beta-Proteobacteria, the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups. Hybridization patterns were used to assess the potential of functional probes in non-PCR-based molecular analysis of natural AAO populations and their activity. The objective of this study was to obtain an overview of functional gene homologies by hybridizing probes derived from N. europaea gene sequences ranging in size from 0.45 to 4.5 kb, and labeled with 32P to Southern blots containing genomic DNA from four Nitrosospira representatives. Probes were specific for genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase (amoA and amoB), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao), and cytochrome c-554 (hcy). These probes produced hybridization signals, at low stringency (30&deg;C), with DNA from each of the four representatives; signals at higher stringency (42&deg;C) were greatly reduced or absent. The hybridization signals at low stringency ranged from 20 to 76% of the total signal obtained with N. europaea DNA. These results indicate that all four functional genes in the ammonia oxidation pathway have diverged between the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups. The hao probe produced the most consistent hybridization intensities among the Nitrosospira representatives, suggesting that hao sequences would provide the best probes for non-PCR-based molecular analysis of terrestrial AAOs. Since N. europaea can also denitrify, an additional objective was to hybridize genomic DNA from AAOs with probes for Pseudomonas genes involved in denitrification. These probes were specific for genes encoding heme-type dissimilatory nitrite reductase (dNir), Cu-type dNir, and nitrous oxide reductase (nosz). No hybridization signals were observed from probes for the heme-type dNir or nosz, but Nitrosospira sp. NpAV and Nitrosolobus sp. 24-C hybridized, under low-stringency conditions, with the Cu-type dNir probe. These results indicate that AAOs may also differ in their mechanisms and capacities for denitrification. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 64: 4333-4339.	Within the last several years, molecular techniques have uncovered numerous 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences which represent a unique and globally distributed lineage of the kingdom Crenarchaeota that is phylogenetically distinct from currently characterized crenarchaeotal species. rDNA sequences of members of this novel crenarchaeotal group have been recovered from low- to moderate-temperature environments (1.5 to 32&deg;C), in contrast to the high-temperature environments (temperature, &gt;80&deg;C) required for growth of the currently recognized crenarchaeotal species. We determined the diversity and abundance of the nonthermophilic members of the Crenarchaeota in soil samples taken from cultivated and uncultivated fields located at the Kellogg Biological Station's Long-Term Ecological Research site (Hickory Corners, Mich.). Clones were generated from 16S rDNA that was amplified by using broad-specificity archaeal PCR primers. Twelve crenarchaeotal sequences were identified, and the phylogenetic relationships between these sequences and previously described crenarchaeotal 16S rDNA sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analyses included nonthermophilic crenarchaeotal sequences found in public databases and revealed that the nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota group is composed of at least four distinct phylogenetic clusters. A 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for all known nonthermophilic crenarchaeotal sequences was designed and used to determine their abundance in soil samples. The nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota accounted for as much as 1.42% &plusmn; 0.42% of the 16S rRNA in the soils analyzed. 	1	\N

Soil microbial communities are integrally involved in biogeochemical cycles and their activities are crucial to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the importance of soil microorganisms, little is known about the distribution of microorganisms in the soil or the manner in which microbial community structure responds to changes in land management. We investigated the structure of microbial communities in the soil over two years in a series of replicated plots, that included, cultivated fields, fields abandoned from cultivation and fields with no history of cultivation. Microbial community structure was examined by monitoring the relative abundance of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from seven of the most common bacterial groups in soil (the Alpha and Beta Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cytophagales, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and the Acidobacteria) and the Eukarya. These data reveal that soil microbial communities are dynamic, capable of significant change at temporal scales relative to seasonal events. However, despite temporal change in microbial community structure, the rRNA relative abundance of particular microbial groups is affected by the local environment such that recognizable patterns of community structure exist in relation to field management. 	1	\N

The Verrucomicrobia constitute a newly discovered division of the Bacteria identified as a numerically abundant component of soil microbial communities in numerous sites around the world. The relative abundance of rRNA from Verrucomicrobia was investigated in the soil to examine the influence of specific environmental factors on the distribution of Verrucomicrobia and to better understand the distribution of this group in terrestrial ecosystems. The abundance of the verrucomicrobial rRNA was determined by using a novel oligonucleotide probe that is specific for verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA. The abundance of verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA in soil microbial communities was determined in relation to plant community composition and soil management history over a period of 2 years. Additional samples were analyzed to determine if verrucomicrobial rRNA relative abundance changes in relation to either soil depth or soil moisture content. The Verrucomicrobia composed 1.9&plusmn;0.2% of the microbial community rRNA present in the 85 soil samples examined. The distribution of verrucomicrobial rRNA in the soil reveals that Verrucomicrobia are significantly affected by environmental characteristics that change in relation to time, soil history, and soil depth, and reveals that a statistically significant amount of the variation in verrucomicrobial rRNA abundance can be explained by changes in soil moisture content. 	1	\N

The structure of microbial communities was examined as a function of community composition and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups to examine the effects that plant community composition and land-use history have on microbial communities in the soil. The sites sampled were part of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project in agricultural ecology at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State University (Hickory Corners, MI) and included both active and abandoned agricultural fields as well as nearby fields that had never been cultivated. Microbial community structure was assessed by extracting total RNA from soil samples and using 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to quantify the abundance of rRNA from the alpha, beta, and gamma Proteobacteria, the Actinobacteria (Gram positive bacteria with a high mol % G+C genome), the Bacteria, and the Eukarya. In addition, soil microbial communities were characterized by examining fluorescently tagged terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) in PCR amplified 16S rDNA. Microbial community structure was observed to be remarkably similar among plots that shared a long-term history of agricultural management despite differences in plant community composition and land management that have been maintained on the plots in recent years. In contrast, microbial community structure differed significantly between fields that had never been cultivated and those having a long-term history of cultivation. 	1	\N

Transactions American Society Agricultural Engineering 42: 1868-1877. 	The current soil water component of the CROPGRO-Soybean model was structured for deep, well-drained soils. It did not have mechanisms for restricting root growth and root water uptake in soil layers with high mechanical impedance or soil layers with non-uniform root distribution. In this research, the model was modified to consider root growth and root water uptake under those conditions. Experimental data sets from Castana, Iowa, find Gainesville, Florida, with two contrasting soils were used for model validation. An empirical soil impedance factor was incorporated to influence the ability of roots to grow and proliferate in a layer: A root hospitality or clumping factor was incorporated to limit root water uptake in soil layers where roots are not uniformly distributed. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effects of these two factors and rate of root depth increase on root growth, soil wafer extraction, seed yield, and crop biomass. Root growth and soil factors were adjusted so that simulated soil water extraction from each soil layer correctly matched observed data. A maximum rate of vertical root growth was estimated to be 4.0 cm d(-1) for both locations. Root distribution with depth, soil water extraction pattern, and simulated crop responses were highly sensitive to this parameter In both soils, the root hospitality factor was 1.0 (implying uniform root distribution) from the soil surface to layers near the bottom of the root zone below which roots extracted water at lower rates. Both soils required a soil impedance factor at 30 to 45 cm of 0.2 or less to match the apparent vertical rate of root growth, root length distribution with depth, and observed soil water extraction patterns.  After confirming that the model accurately simulated soil water extraction patterns in both locations, the model predicted aboveground growth and yield very well at both locations. In the Castana experiment predicted seed yield was 3127 kg ha(-1) and mean measured seed yield was 2644 kg ha(-1). In Gainesville final seed yield predicted by the model was 1299 kg ha(-1) and measured seed yield was 1178 kg ha(-1). This research confirms the importance of root growth and root proliferation on soil water extraction, crop growth and yield, and it demonstrates the need for additional research to develop relationships between soil properties that are routinely measured and relatively simple root growth and distribution characteristics. 	1	\N

Analysis of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles extracted from soils is a rapid and inexpensive procedure that holds great promise in describing soil microbial community structure without traditional reliance on selective culturing, which seems to severely underestimate community diversity. Interpretation of FAME profiles from environmental samples can be difficult because many fatty acids are common to different microorganisms and many fatty acids are extracted from each soil sample. We used principal components (PCA) and cluster analyses to identify similarities and differences among soil microbial communities described using FAME profiles. We also used PCA to identify particular FAMEs that characterized soil sample clusters. Fatty acids that are found only or primarily in particular microbial taxa - marker fatty acids - were used in conjunction with these analyses. We found that the majority of 162 soil samples taken from a conventionally-tilled corn field had similar FAME profiles but that about 20% of samples seemed to have relatively low, and that about 10% had relatively high, bacterial:fungal ratios. Using semivariance analysis we identified 21:0 iso as a new marker fatty acid. Concurrent use of geostatistical and FAME analyses may be a powerful means of revealing other potential marker FAMEs. When microbial communities from the same samples were cultured on R2A agar and their FAME profiles analyzed, there were many differences between FAME profiles of soil and plated communities, indicating that profiles of FAMEs extracted from soil reveal portions of the microbial community not culturable on R2A. When subjected to PCA, however, a small number of plated communities were found to be distinct due to some of the same profile characteristics (high in 12:0 iso, 15:0 and 17:1 ante A) that identified soil community FAME profiles as distinct. Semivariance analysis indicated that spatial distributions of soil microbial populations are maintained in a portion of the microbial community that is selected on laboratory media. These similarities between whole soil and plated community FAME profiles suggest that plated communities are not solely the result of selection by the growth medium, but reflect the distribution, in situ, of the dominant, culturable soil microbial populations. 	1	\N

The ecosystem consequences of microbial diversity are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity influences ecosystem function by quantifying denitrification enzyme activity among denitrifying bacteria isolated from two geomorphically similar soils with significantly different in situ nitrous oxide (N2O) emission rates. We sampled soil from two southwest Michigan sites on the same soil series that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime - a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field. We isolated denitrifying bacteria from these soils, characterized them based on their fatty acid profiles, and compared denitrifier community composition for the two fields. For 31 representative isolates, we measured the sensitivity of nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) - which catalyzes the reduction of N2O to N-2 - to low oxygen concentrations. Of the 93 denitrifying bacteria isolated from the agricultural held and 63 from the successional field, fatty acid profiles suggested the presence of 27 denitrifying taxa with only 12 common to both soils. In each field type the four numerically dominant taxa were either rare or absent in the other field. In addition, we found substantial diversity in the sensitivity of isolate Nos enzymes to oxygen, indicating that the taxonomic diversity present among denitrifiers in these two soils is functionally significant. These results demonstrate a clear physiological basis for differences in denitrifier community function previously described (Cavigelli and Robertson, 2000. The functional significance of denitrifier community composition in a terrestrial ecosystem. Ecology 81, 229-241.) and indicate that differences in denitrifier community composition alone can potentially influence in situ N2O production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

26	Cavigelli, M.A. and G.P. Robertson. 2000. The functional significance of denitrifier community composition in a terrestrial ecosystem. Ecology 81: 1402-1414.	We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime -- a conventionally-tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field -- in southwest Michigan. We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production [&Delta;N2O/(&Delta;N2O+N2)], or rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN2O differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. Oxygen inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in N2O production (nitrate reductase, Nar; nitrite reductase, Nir; and nitric oxide reductase, Nor) to a greater extent in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field than in the community from the successional field. The Nar, Nir and Nor enzymes of the denitrifying community from the successional field, on the other hand, were more sensitive to pH than were those in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field. Moreover, the denitrifying community in the soil from the successional field had relatively more active nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) enzymes, which reduce N2O to N2, than the denitrifying community in the agricultural field. Also, the shape of the rN2O curve with increasing oxygen was different for each denitrifying community. Each of these differences suggests that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner. We thus conclude that native microbial community composition regulates an important ecosystem function in these soils. 	1	\N

Environmental Entomology 26: 519-527	The associations between common ground beetles and habitat and management characteristics were studied in an agricultural landscape that comprised part of the Long-Term Ecological Research site in southwestern Michigan. The 42-ha area included 7 habitat treatments, which represented 4 annual cropping systems in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., corn, Zea mays L., soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., rotation; 2 perennial crop systems (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., and Populus); and a native succession habitat. Pitfall traps were used to sample adult ground beetles during the growing seasons of 1994 and 1995. Four species numerically dominated the trap catches and together accounted for 87% of the total specimens collected: Cyclotrachelus sodalis (LeConte), Poecilus lucublandus (Say), Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), and Agonum placidum (Say). Differences in representation of these common species were most pronounced between perennial and annual plant systems. However, tillage also influenced the relative abundance of these species. The adult-overwintering, spring-breeding species, P. lucublandus and A. placidum, were most common in the annual crop habitats, particularly those under conventional tillage. Catch numbers of these 2 species were correlated positively suggesting similar habitat preferences or responses to management practices. In contrast, C. sodalis, a larval-overwintering, autumn breeder, was most common in the perennial crop systems and the annual crop system receiving no tillage. The exotic species P. melanarius showed the least response to the agricultural habitat treatments but was more abundant in managed crop habitats compared with the unmanaged succession habitat. Cluster analysis based on these 4 species indicated that plant type and tillage were important in distiniquishing the carabids of these habitats. The potential implications of these findings for conserving or enhancing ground beetle populations in agricultural systems are discussed. 	1	\N

Soil carbon dynamics in corn-based agroecosystems: results from carbon-13 natural abundance. Soil Science Society of America Journal 63: 584-591	We used natural C-13 abundance in soils to calculate the fate of C-4-C inputs in fields cropped to continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Soil samples were collected from eight cultivated and six adjacent, noncultivated sites: of the Corn Belt region of the central USA, The amount of organic C in cultivated soils declined an average of 68%, compared with adjacent, noncultivated sites. The delta C-13 Of cultivated soil profiles that had been under continuous corn for 8 to 35 yr increased in all depth increments above that of the noncultivated profiles. The percentage of soil organic C (SOC) derived from corn residues and roots ranged from 22 to 40% of the total C. The proportion of corn-derived C, as determined by this technique, decreased with soil depth and was minimal iri the 50- to 100-cm depth increments of fine-fextured soils. The mean residence time of the non-corn C (C-3) ranged from 36 to 108 yr at the surface, and np to 769 yr at the subsoil depth, The longer turnover times were associated with soils high in clay. Prairie-derived soils have a higher potential to sequester C than those derived from forests. The significant loss of total C at all sites and the slow turnover times of the incorporated C lead us to conclude that there is a substantial potential for soils to serve as a C sink and as a significant nutrient reserve in sustainable agriculture. 	1	\N

Soil Biology and Biochemistry 32:157-168	The dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) play an important role in long-term ecosystem productivity and the global C cycle. We used extended laboratory incubation and acid hydrolysis to analytically determine SOC pool sizes and fluxes in US Corn Belt soils derived from both forest and prairie vegetation. Measurement of the natural abundance of C-13 made it possible to follow the influence of continuous corn on SOC accumulation. The active pools (C-a) comprised 3 to 8% of the SOC with an average field mean residence time (MRT) of 100 d. The slow pools (C-s) comprised 50% of SOC in the surface and up to 65% in subsoils. They had field MRTs from 12-28 y for C-4-C and 40-80 y for C-3-derived C depending on soil type and location. No-till management increased the MRT of the C-3-C by 10-15 y above conventional tillage. The resistant pool (C-r) decreased from an average of 50% at the surface to 30% at depth. The isotopic composition of SOC mineralized during the early stages of incubation reflected accumulations of labile C from the incorporation of corn residues. The CO2 released later reflected C-13 characteristic of the C-s pool. The C-13 Of the CO2 did not equal that of the whole soil until after 1000 d of incubation. The SOC dynamics determined by acid hydrolysis, incubation and C-13 content were dependent on soil heritage (prairie vs. forest), texture, cultivation and parent material, depositional characteristics. Two independent methods of determining C-3 pool sizes derived from C-3 vegetation gave highly correlated values. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 	1	\N

Population trends over time were summarized for ii species of resident coccinellids before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. In addition, annual population increase, habitat utilization patterns, and within-season population fluctuation for H. axyridis were analyzed H. axyridis became a dominant coccinellid species in the landscape 4 yr after its arrival. Adults of this species were found in all habitats monitored, including early secondary succession, poplar plantation, alfalfa, soybean, corn, and winter wheat. Significant population peaks were observed early and late in the season, depending on the habitat. Resident species that appear affected by the establishment of H. axyridis are Brachiacantha ursina (F.), Cycloneda munda (Say), and Chilocorus stigma (Say). However, to attribute the decline on the numbers of those species to H. axyridis will require further assessment. 	1	\N

Environmental Entomology 26: 797-804	Changes in species assemblages of predatory coccinellids in response to landscape structure (habitat diversity and patchiness) was studied in a southern Michigan landscape during 1989-1990. Three sites with different mosaics of cultivated (alfalfa, corn, wheat) and uncultivated (deciduous, field succession) habitats were sampled for coccinellid species using yellow sticky traps. The landscape at each site was characterized using the Berger-Parker index for habitat diversity and a relative patchiness index for habitat fragmentation. Relative abundance, species richness, species dominance, and the Kendall coefficient were used to analyze and compare species assemblages among sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract factor components per species and site scores, which were compared with landscape indices using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Thirteen species of coccinellids were captured during the 2 yr of weekly sampling. Of these species, Coccinella septempunctata (L.) was the dominant species in the landscape and was equally abundant in the 3 sites. Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake was more abundant in the site that had a corn habitat, whereas Cycloneda munda (Say), Chilocorus stigma (Say), and Brachiacantha ursina (F.) were more abundant in the site that had a deciduous habitat. Overall, the site with a deciduous habitat had higher species richness. There were significant differences in species composition between the site with a deciduous habitat and the other 2 sites. Differences observed among sites were significantly correlated with the presence of uncultivated habitats in the landscape.	1	\N

Effect of food resources on adult Glyptapanteles milataris and Meterrus communis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), parasitoids of Pseudaletia unipuncta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Environmental Entomology 33: 128-137	Adult parasitoids frequently require access to food and adequate microclimates to maximize host location and parasitization. Realized levels of parasitism in the field can be significantly influenced by the quantity and distribution of extra-host resources. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant effect of landscape structure on parasitism of the armyworm Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). As a possible mechanism underlying this pattern, we investigated the effect of carbohydrate food sources on the longevity and fecundity of armyworm parasitoids under laboratory conditions of varying temperature, host availability, and mating status. Glyptapanteles, militaris (Walsh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) adults lived significantly longer when provided with honey as food and when reared at 20degreesC versus 25degreesC. Meteorus communis (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) adults also lived significantly longer when provided with honey, although longevity was reduced when females were provided hosts. Honey-fed females of M. communis parasitized significantly more hosts because of their increased longevity, but did not differ in daily oviposition from females provided only water. Mating significantly increased parasitism by honey-fed M. communis, but not those provided water alone. These results indicate that the presence of both carbohydrate resources and moderated microclimates may significantly increase the life span and parasitism of these parasitoids. However, the greater longevity and lower daily rate of oviposition of M. communis suggest that food and microclimate resources are more critical for this species than for the shorter lived, gregarious G. militaris. These findings contribute to our understanding of how these two parasitoids respond to landscape complexity. 	1	\N
34	Dalal, R. C., W. Wang, G. P. Robertson, and W. J. Parton. 2003. Nitrous oxide emission from Australian agricultural lands and mitigation options: a review. Australian Journal of Soil Research 41: 165-195	Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and halocarbons in the atmosphere due to human activities are associated with global climate change. The concentration of N2O has increased by 16% since 1750. Although the atmospheric concentration of N2O is much smaller (314 ppb in 1998) than of CO2 (365 ppm), its global warming potential ( cumulative radiative forcing) is 296 times that of the latter in a 100-year time horizon. Currently, it contributes about 6% of the overall global warming effect but its contribution from the agricultural sector is about 16%. Of that, almost 80% of N2O is emitted from Australian agricultural lands, originating from N fertilisers (32%), soil disturbance (38%), and animal waste (30%).  Nitrous oxide is primarily produced in soil by the activities of microorganisms during nitrification, and denitrification processes. The ratio of N2O to N-2 production depends on oxygen supply or water-filled pore space, decomposable organic carbon, N substrate supply, temperature, and pH and salinity. N2O production from soil is sporadic both in time and space, and therefore, it is a challenge to scale up the measurements of N2O emission from a given location and time to regional and national levels. Estimates of N2O emissions from various agricultural systems vary widely. For example, in flooded rice in the Riverina Plains, N2O emissions ranged from 0.02% to 1.4% of fertiliser N applied, whereas in irrigated sugarcane crops, 15.4% of fertiliser was lost over a 4-day period. Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilised dairy pasture soils in Victoria range from 6 to 11 kg N2O-N/ ha, whereas in arable cereal cropping, N2O emissions range from &lt; 0.01% to 9.9% of N fertiliser applications. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil nitrite and nitrates resulting from residual fertiliser and legumes are rarely studied but probably exceed those from fertilisers, due to frequent wetting and drying cycles over a longer period and larger area. In ley cropping systems, significant N2O losses could occur, from the accumulation of mainly nitrate-N, following mineralisation of organic N from legume-based pastures. Extensive grazed pastures and rangelands contribute annually about 0.2 kg N/ha as N2O (93 kg/ha per year CO2-equivalent). Tropical savannas probably contribute an order of magnitude more, including that from frequent fires. Unfertilised forestry systems may emit less but the fertilised plantations emit more N2O than the extensive grazed pastures. However, currently there are limited data to quantify N2O losses in systems under ley cropping, tropical savannas, and forestry in Australia. Overall, there is a need to examine the emission factors used in estimating national N2O emissions; for example, 1.25% of fertiliser or animal- excreted N appearing as N2O (IPCC 1996). The primary consideration for mitigating N2O emissions from agricultural lands is to match the supply of mineral N ( from fertiliser applications, legume-fixed N, organic matter, or manures) to its spatial and temporal needs by crops/pastures/trees. Thus, when appropriate, mineral N supply should be regulated through slow-release (urease and/or nitrification inhibitors, physical coatings, or high C/N ratio materials) or split fertiliser application. Also, N use could be maximised by balancing other nutrient supplies to plants. Moreover, non-legume cover crops could be used to take up residual mineral N following N-fertilised main crops or mineral N accumulated following legume leys. For manure management, the most effective practice is the early application and immediate incorporation of manure into soil to reduce direct N2O emissions as well as secondary emissions from deposition of ammonia volatilised from manure and urine. Current models such as DNDC and DAYCENT can be used to simulate N2O production from soil after parameterisation with the local data, and appropriate modification and verification against the measured N2O emissions under different management practices. In summary, improved estimates of N2O emission from agricultural lands and mitigation options can be achieved by a directed national research program that is of considerable duration, covers sampling season and climate, and combines different techniques ( chamber and micrometeorological) using high precision analytical instruments and simulation modelling, under a range of strategic activities in the agriculture sector. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 64: 170-176	Minimum tillage may alter soil P fractions through the application of P fertilizers and the deposition of organic matter on the surface rather than being incorporated into the soil. This study was conducted to determine whether no-tillage (NT) systems affected soil organic and inorganic P fractions and the transformation of P from residues applied to soils. Surface soils (0-2 cm) under NT and conventional tillage (CT) were sampled from three long-term research sites. Inorganic and organic P was measured in the NaHCO3 microbial, NaOH, NaOH after sonication, HCl, and residual fractions extracted sequentially. Soybean (Glycine maw L.) residues labeled with P-33 were added to soils, incubated, and extracted periodically, and P-33 was counted in the different P fractions. Levels of (3)1P in NT were higher in some of the fractions compared with CT; however, there was no consistency in P-31 fractionation across soil types due to tillage in any of the inorganic and organic fractions. At the start of incubation, 56 to 82% of the applied P-33 was extracted in the resin fraction in the three soils. Resin-P-33 followed a three-parameter single exponential decay model with a corresponding increase in other pools depending on soil. The increase in these pools followed a quadratic model in the three soils. By the end of the incubation period, the NaOH fraction accounted for the majority of the UP released from the labile resin pool. An increase in the calcium phosphate pool occurred in the calcareous soil. Tillage had no effect on the fate of P-33 released from soybean residues during the incubation period. 	1	\N
36	Daroub, S., B. G. Ellis, and G. P. Robertson. 2001. Effect of cropping and low-chemical input systems on soil phosphorus fractions. Soil Science 166: 281-291.	The adoption of alternative management practices has been shown to increase soil organic matter. However, the effect of adopting these practices on soil phosphorus (P), especially organic P, is not clear. We evaluated the effect of such practices-mainly no-tillage, zero and low-chemical input, organic-based, row crop agricultural systems-on soil P and compared them with conventional agriculture and perennial farming systems. We also compared soil P under conventional agriculture to an adjacent forest site and a never-tilled native successional community site in southwest Michigan. Sequential fractionation analysis of soil inorganic and organic P fractions showed that long-term conventional row crop agriculture resulted in a 79% reduction of NaOH-extractable organic P compared with adjacent forested sites. The calcium phosphate pool and the residual P fraction, however, increased under conventional agriculture compared with the forest site, probably because of fertilizer inputs. Adoption of no-tillage and low-chemical input systems with a winter leguminous cover crop in the rotation for 7 years did not increase organic P significantly in any of the fractions extracted from the annual cropping systems. However, organic P extracted by NaOH increased to 22.1% after adoption of continuous alfalfa for the same period compared with 11.4% extracted under conventionally tilled annual cropping systems. We conclude that continuous alfalfa. can help restore soils to their native P fertility levels by taking up P from the stable residual fraction and transforming it into moderately labile organic P through root death. We found no evidence that low chemical input organic based systems are sustainable with regard to P as there is no evidence that organic P is accumulating as a result of the use of cover crops. Further investigation is warranted after these soils become P limiting and more years have passed under the same treatments. 	1	\N

Environmental factors affecting seedbank persistence of 13 annual weeds across the U.S. corn belt. Weed Science 53: 296-306.	Weed seedbanks have been studied intensively at local scales, but to date, there have been no regional-scale studies of weed seedbank persistence. Empirical and modeling studies indicate that reducing weed seedbank persistence can play an important role in integrated weed management. Annual seedbank persistence of 13 summer annual weed species was studied from 2001 through 2003 at eight locations in the north central United States and one location in the northwestern United States. Effects of seed depth placement, tillage, and abiotic environmental factors on seedbank persistence were examined through regression and multivariate ordinations. All species examined showed a negative relationship between hydrothermal time and seedbank persistence. Seedbank persistence was very similar between the two years of the study for common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, and velvetleaf when data were pooled over location, depth, and tillage. Seedbank persistence of common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, and velvetleaf from October 2001 through 2002 and October 2002 through 2003 was, respectively, 52.3% and 60.0%, 21.3% and 21.8%, and 57.5% and 57.2%. These results demonstrate that robust estimates of seedbank persistence are possible when many observations are averaged over numerous locations. Future studies are needed to develop methods of reducing seedbank persistence, especially for weed species with particularly long-lived seeds. 	1	\N

Carbon (C) can be sequestered in the mineral soil after the conversion of intensively cropped agricultural fields to more extensive land uses such as afforested and natural succession ecosystems. Three land-use treatments from the long-term ecological research site at Kellogg biological station in Michigan were compared with a nearby deciduous forest. Treatments included a conventionally tilled cropland, a former cropland afforested with poplar for 10 years and an old field (10 years) succession. We used soil aggregate and soil organic matter fractionation techniques to isolate C pools that (1) have a high potential for C storage and (2) accumulate C at a fast rate during afforestation or succession. These fractions could serve as sensitive indicators for the total change in C content due to land-use changes. At the mineral soil surface (0-7 cm), afforesting significantly increased soil aggregation to levels similar to native forest. However, surface soil (0-7 cm) C did not follow this trend: soil C of the native forest site (22.9 t C ha(-1)) was still significantly greater than the afforested (12.6 t C ha(-1)) and succession (15.4 t C ha(-1)) treatments. However, when the 0-50 cm soil layer was considered, no differences in total soil C were observed between the cropland and the poplar afforested system, while the successional system increased total soil C (0-50 cm) at a rate of 0.786 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Afforested soils sequestered C mainly in the fine intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (POM) (53-250 mum), whereas the successional soils sequestered C preferentially in the mineral-associated organic matter and fine intra-aggregate POM C pools. 	1	\N

These measurements, which are fully polarimetric, took place over the entire growing season of 1996, To reduce the data acquisition burden, these measurements were restricted to 45 degrees in elevation and to 45 degrees in azimuth with respect to the row direction. Using the first order radiative transfer solution as a form for the model of the data, four parameters were extracted from the data for each frequency/polarization channel to provide a least squares fit to the model. Ebr inversion, particular channel combinations were regressed against the soil moisture and area density of vegetation water mass. Using L-band cross-polarization and VV-polarization, the vegetation water mass can be regressed with an R-2 = 0.867 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0678 kg/m(2), Similarly, while a number of channels, or combinations of channels, can be used to invert for soil moisture, the best combination observed, namely, L-band VV-polarization, C-band HV- and VV-polarizations, can achieve a regression coefficient of R-2 = 0.898 and volumetric soil moisture RMSE of 1.75%. 	1	\N

Tank, H. M. Valett, J. R. Webster, and W. M. Wollheim. 2002. N uptake as a function of concentration in streams. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 21: 206-220.	Detailed studies of stream N uptake were conducted in a prairie reach and gallery forest reach of Kings Creek on the Konza Prairie Biological Station. Nutrient uptake rates were measured with multiple short-term enrichments of NO3- and NH4+ at constant addition rates in the spring and summer of 1998. NH4+ uptake was also measured with N-15-NH4+ tracer additions and short-term unlabeled NH4+ additions at 12 stream sites across North America. Concurrent addition of a conservative tracer was used to account for dilution in all experiments. NH4+ uptake rate per unit area (U-t) was positively correlated to nutrient concentration across all sites (r(2) = 0.41, log-log relationship). Relationships between concentration and U-t were used to determine whether the uptake was nonlinear (i.e., kinetic uptake primarily limited by the biotic capacity of microorganisms to accumulate nutrients) or linear (e.g., limited by mass transport into stream biofilms). In all systems, U-t was lower at ambient concentrations than at elevated concentrations. Extrapolation from uptake measured from a series of increasing enrichments could be used to estimate ambient U-t Linear extrapolation of U-t assuming the relationship passes through the origin and rates measured at 1 elevated nutrient concentration underestimated ambient U-t by similar to3-fold. Uptake rates were saturated under some but not all conditions of enrichment; in some cases there was no saturation up to 50 mumol/L. The absolute concentration at which U-t was saturated in Kings Creek varied among reaches and nutrients. Uptake rates of NH4+ at ambient concentrations in all streams were higher than would be expected, assuming U-t does not saturate with increasing concentrations. At ambient nutrient concentrations in unpolluted streams, U-t is probably limited to some degree by the kinetic uptake capacity of stream biota. Mass transfer velocity from the water column is generally greater than would be expected given typical diffusion rates, underscoring the importance of advective transport. Given the short-term spikes in nutrient concentrations that can occur in streams (e.g., in response to storm events), U-t may not saturate, even at high concentrations. 	1	\N

Oecologia 140: 458-467	Stoichiometric analyses can be used to investigate the linkages between N and C cycles and how these linkages influence biogeochemistry at many scales, from components of individual ecosystems up to the biosphere. N-specific NH4+ uptake rates were measured in eight streams using short-term N-15 tracer additions, and C to N ratios (C:N) were determined from living and non-living organic matter collected from ten streams. These data were also compared to previously published data compiled from studies of lakes, ponds, wetlands, forests, and tundra. There was a significant negative relationship between C:N and N-specific uptake rate; C:N could account for 41% of the variance in N-specific uptake rate across all streams, and the relationship held in five of eight streams. Most of the variation in N-specific uptake rate was contributed by detrital and primary producer compartments with large values of C:N and small values for N-specific uptake rate. In streams, particulate materials are not as likely to move downstream as dissolved N, so if N is cycling in a particulate compartment, N retention is likely to be greater. Together, these data suggest that N retention may depend in part on C:N of living and non-living organic matter in streams. Factors that alter C:N of stream ecosystem compartments, such as removal of riparian vegetation or N fertilization, may influence the amount of retention attributed to these ecosystem compartments by causing shifts in stoichiometry. Our analysis suggests that C:N of ecosystem compartments can be used to link N-cycling models across streams.	1	\N

Ergosterol is a sterol common to many fungi and may be useful for estimating fungal biomass in soil. Our objective was to compare three different methods for extracting ergosterol from soil. These included: (i) a published method that involves extraction with methanol, saponification with KOH, and separation with hexane before analysis using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC); (ii) a recently published supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method; and (iii) a simplified extraction method developed in our laboratory that is similar to method (i) but requires 80 to 90% less reagents. Similar quantities of ergosterol were extracted from both prairie and cropland soil with method (i) and with simplified method (iii). In contrast, the SFE method (ii) did not recover naturally occurring ergosterol from soil. Extraction effciencies of ergosterol standards added to soil were between 75 and 88% for the three procedures, with coefficients of variation of &lt;15% for all methods. Our simplified method substantially reduced cost, extraction time, and chemical waste per sample. Results of this study indicate that the simplified method was the most efficient technique for extraction of ergosterol from soil. 	1	\N

Remotely sensed data can aid in estimating biophysical variables of corn (Zea mays L.). This study identifies spectral wavelengths, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and timing needed for estimating yield and leaf area index (LAI) for corn. Canopy reflectance (460-810 nm range) was measured periodically in 1999 and 2000 within a field study varying N and irrigation management for corn. Corn grain yield was strongly related to canopy reflectance for either individual wavelengths or for SVIs, reaching an optimum (R-2 &gt; 0.9) at R5 dent stage in both years. Green reflectance based on simple ratio (green simple ratio index, GSRI) had the highest R-2, lowest RMSE, and most consistent slope and intercept between years. In contrast, LAI was best predicted by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (RSME = 0.426) while green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) performed poorly (RMSE = 0.604). Corn grain yield in this study was best predicted at stage R5 using the green simple ratio index. 	1	\N

Linking ecology and economics for ecosystem management. BioScience 56: 121-133.	This article outlines an approach, based on ecosystem services, for assessing the trade-offs inherent in managing humans embedded in ecological systems. Evaluating these trade-offs requires an understanding of the biophysical magnitudes of the changes in ecosystem services that result from human actions, and of the impact of these changes on human welfare. We summarize the state of the art of ecosystem services-based management and the information needs for applying it. Three case studies of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites-coastal, urban, and agricultural-illustrate the usefulness, information needs, quantification possibilities, and methods for this approach. One example of the application of this approach, with rigorously established service changes and valuations taken front the literature, is used to illustrate the potential for full economic valuation of several agricultural landscape management options, including managing for water quality biodiversity, and crop productivity. 	1	\N

A cross-system comparison of bacterial and fungal biomass in detritus pools of headwater streams. Microbial Ecology 43: 55-66.	The absolute amount of microbial biomass and relative contribution of fungi and bacteria are expected to vary among types of organic matter (OM) within a stream and will vary among streams because of differences in organic matter quality and quantity. Common types of benthic detritus [leaves, small wood, and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM)] were sampled in 9 small (1st-3rd order) streams selected to represent a range of important controlling factors such as surrounding vegetation, detritus standing stocks, and water chemistry. Direct counts of bacteria and measurements of ergosterol (a fungal sterol) were used to describe variation in bacterial and fungal biomass. There were significant differences in bacterial abundance among types of organic matter with higher densities per unit mass of organic matter on fine particles relative to either leaves or wood surfaces. In contrast, ergosterol concentrations were significantly greater on leaves and wood, confirming the predominance of fungal biomass in these larger size classes. In general, bacterial abundance per unit organic matter was less variable than fungal biomass, suggesting bacteria will be a more predictable component of stream microbial communities. For 7 of the 9 streams, the standing stock of fine benthic organic matter was large enough that habitat-weighted reach-scale bacterial biomass was equal to or greater than fungal biomass. The quantities of leaves and small wood varied among streams such that the relative contribution of reach-scale fungal biomass ranged from 10% to as much as 90% of microbial biomass. Ergosterol concentrations were positively associated with substrate C:N ratio while bacterial abundance was negatively correlated with C:N. Both these relationships are confounded by particle size, i.e., leaves and wood had higher C:N than fine benthic organic matter. There was a weak positive relationship between bacterial abundance and streamwater soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, but no apparent pattern between either bacteria or fungi and streamwater dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The variation in microbial biomass per unit organic matter and the relative abundance of different types of organic matter contributed equally to driving differences in total microbial biomass at the reach scale. 	1	\N

Seasonal changes in nitrification potential associated with application of N fertilizer and compost in maize systems of southwest Michigan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and the Environment 97: 285-293.	Nitrification potential is the maximum capacity of a soil's population of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH4+-N to NO3--N. Time of season and the effect of several management practices on nitrification potentials were measured via an amended slurry method, shaken for 24 h at 25 degreesC. Management strategies that reduce potential nitrification rates without limiting plant N uptake may increase the ratio of plant biomass to plant N content (PB:N), the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) per unit of N in ANPP, and decrease the amount of NO3- available for leaching, and/or conversion to N2O. Sites were located in Hickory Corners, MI, USA, on Haplic Luvisols. Management practices included: substitution of compost for N fertilizer, use of a rotation in place of continuous maize and the addition of cover crops. A previously tilled, successional grassland was used as a contrast to agricultural managements. Where N fertilizer was applied, nitrification potential increased in late May and again in late August-October. The seasonal pattern was similar but less pronounced where compost was applied. Nitrification rates were 4.2 times greater than that of the successional site when N fertilizer was applied. Use of N fertilizer increased nitrification potentials 1.5 times above treatments where compost was applied during 1998 and 1999 in the 6th and 7th years of the rotation. In some instances, nitrification potentials could be correlated with in situ NO3--N measurements. Average PB:Ns in the fertilizer management were greater or equivalent to the successional grassland site. Compost increased PB:N above that of N fertilizer. Utilization of compost decreased nitrification potentials, maintained yields, and increased PB:N. The crop N content was lower when compost was applied. Thus, grain and stover quality may be lowered and need to be monitored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 	1	\N

Management practices that influence the quantity of C inputs returned to the soil from cropping systems and compost applications alter subsequent biotic activity broadly, contribute to seasonal fluctuations in nutrient dynamics, and may increase C sequestration. The effects of crop rotations and compost applications on soil-C sequestration and decompostion, and the turnover time of C-4-derived corn C were assessed via changes in the C content and C-13 values of particulate organic matter (POM) and total soil organic C (SCIC). The majority of organic inputs entered the POM fraction, defined as the sand-sized soil separates remaining on a 53-mum sieve after removal of residues (&gt;2 mm), dispersion in 5% sodium polyphosphate, and 12 h of shaking. Before the application of compost to soil, 85% of the C in the compost material was classified as PCIM. Measurements of POM-C in the soil were 45% higher and SOC was 16% greater where compost was applied in place of N fertilizer. Addition of compost to POM-C diminished the value of POM as an indicator of short-term changes in nutrient dynamics. However, POM-C remaining from compost applications made during the period 1993 to 1997 may be an indicator of enhanced macroaggregate stability: improved soil tilth and the retention of soil C and N. The turnover time of C4-derived C in the POM fraction was 11 years compared with 22 years in SOC. The presence of compost C did not affect the turnover time of corn-derived C. High cropping intensity and chisel plow management increased C sequestration relative to the preceding alfalfa management. 	1	\N

Temporal and spatial variability of woody plant establishment in Michigan old-fields. American Midland Naturalist 142: 229-243. 	We investigated temporal and spatial patterns of woody plant establishment in the first 7 y of succession in southwest Michigan old fields. From the 2nd to the 7th y following agricultural abandonment we conducted annual demographic surveys of woody plants and mapped all stems in six 10 x 20 m permanent grids co measure temporal and spatial patterns of woody stem emergence, mortality, density and species richness. Woody plant succession was characterized by increases in the emergence, density and richness of woody species over time and a shift from early dominance by and-dispersed species to later dominance by bird-dispersed species. The increase in abundance of bird-dispersed stems reflects both clonal reproduction by the dominant bird-dispersed species, Rhus typhina, and establishment from seed by a variety of other bird-dispersed species. Wind and bird-dispersed species differed in spatial pattern within the grids. Wind-dispersed species were distributed at random and bird-dispersed species were aggregated. Aggregation of bird-dispersed species was due to clonal stem production by R. typhina and the concentration of stems of other bird-dispersed species beneath the canopy of Rhus clones. The results highlight the importance of dispersal mode in controlling both the rate of woody plant succession and the development of spatial structure in plant communities. 	1	\N
51	Foster, B. L., and K. L. Gross. 1997. Partitioning the effects of plant biomass and litter on Andropogon gerardi in old-field vegetation. Ecology 78: 2091-2104.	We examined the effects of living plant neighbors and litter on the performance of a native C-4 grass, Andropogon gerardi, at five old-field sites that differ in community biomass and soil fertility. We used plant removal experiments in which both living neighbors and litter were manipulated in a factorial arrangement of treatments over one growing season. Andropogon was added to treatment plots as seeds and as established transplants to examine the effects of the surrounding plant community on the recruitment and established phases of its life history.  Neighbors negatively affected Andropogon performance at all sites, indicating that resource exploitation by living plants was an important constraint to seedling recruitment and growth across the range of community biomass examined. Plant litter negatively affected recruitment at sites with the greatest community biomass, but had no effect on the growth of established transplants at any of the sites. The total effect of the surrounding plant community on recruitment was positively correlated with community biomass due to an increasing impact of plant litter. However, the total effect of the surrounding community on the growth of established transplants was unrelated to community biomass. The results suggest that it may be during the recruitment phase of the life history, when seeds and seedlings are especially susceptible to the effects of both litter and living neighbors, that Andropogon is most sensitive to variation in community biomass. Variation in the effects of litter on recruitment may be important in regulating plant species diversity and the distribution of native C-4 grasses along old-field biomass gradients in southwest Michigan. 	1	\N
52	Foster, B. L., and K. L. Gross. 1998. Species richness in a successional grassland: Effects of nitrogen enrichment and plant litter. Ecology 79: 2593-2602.	We conducted a field experiment in a successional grassland to investigate the short-term effects of nitrogen enrichment and plant litter on plant species richness and on the establishment of a native grass (Andropogon gerardi) that was experimentally introduced to the study site as seed. Additions of nitrogen fertilizer to experimental plots over two growing seasons increased plant production as indicated by increases in both living plant biomass and litter biomass. Increased productivity reduced species richness by effectively preventing the seedling establishment of the subordinate forb species and reduced the recruitment of Andropogon gerardi by inhibiting both germination and survival. Litter removals carried out at each of two levels of nitrogen enrichment (no nitrogen, nitrogen added) showed that litter significantly reduced species richness by the same amount in fertilized and unfertilized plots, suggesting that living biomass and litter were purely additive, rather than interactive in their effects. In contrast, the results of litter additions suggested that the declines in richness associated with fertilization could largely be due to the suppressive effects of increased litter biomass alone. As a whole, the results indicate that litter and living biomass are largely substitutable in their inhibitory effects on species richness in highly productive successional grasslands due to their independent and equivalent capacities to attenuate light to very low levels. This study highlights the combined roles of competition and plant litter in influencing the diversity of grasslands through effects on seedling establishment. 	1	\N
53	Foster, B. L. 1999. Establishment, competition and the distribution of native grasses among Michigan old-fields. Journal of Ecology 87: 476-489	1 In this study the potential role of competition in influencing the distribution of three displaced native perennial grasses across complex gradients of plant productivity and species composition was investigated in Michigan old-fields. To do this plant removal and propagule addition experiments were conducted at nine old-held sites to examine the effects of living plant neighbours and litter on seedling establishment and growth of target species in relation to community biomass.  2 For two target species, Andropogon gerardi and Schizachyrium scoparium, living plant neighbours suppressed establishment from seed at most sites, and suppressed the growth of transplants at all sites. 3 Plant litter strongly inhibited the seedling establishment of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium at sites of high community biomass and litter accumulation, but had little impact on the growth rate of transplants at any of the sites. 4 The total suppressive effect of the plant community on seedling establishment and transplant growth of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium increased in magnitude in a non-linear fashion with community biomass. These effects increased in magnitude more rapidly across sites of low to medium biomass than sites of medium to high biomass. 5 The results suggest that these native grasses maybe restricted to low productivity habitats within this landscape because of strong competitive interference with establishment by the existing vegetation in the most productive sites. 	1	\N

BioControl 50: 545-563. 	The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura is a new invasive pest of soybean in North America. We studied the ability of the existing predator community in soybean to reduce A. glycines establishment in field studies using either predator exclusion, open, or leaky cages that allowed aphid emigration but limited predation. Cages were infested with uniform initial densities of A. glycines adults and subsequent populations of aphids and predators were monitored over 24 h. The most abundant predators in these trials included the carabid beetles Elaphropus anceps (Le Conte), Clavina impressefrons Le Conte, Bembidion quadrimaculatum Say and spiders (Salticidae and Lycosidae). Foliar predators were less abundant and included; Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Coccinella septempunctata (L.), and Orius insidious (Say). Over the 2-year study, we found statistically significant predation on adult A. glycines in one out of six trials at 15 h and two out of six trials at 24 h. There was never significant evidence for predation of nymphs in any trial, however overall survival (adults + nymphs) was significantly reduced in one out of six trials at 15 h and three out of six trials at 24 h. Based on these results we suggest that generalist predators can be a significant but variable factor influencing the establishment of A. glycines populations in soybean. The impact of existing predator communities should be further investigated as a means of managing A. glycines populations in North American soybean production systems. 	1	\N

The effect of disturbance on soil nematode communities was studied in eight treatments varying in intensity of human intervention at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site, Hickory Comers, MI. The agricultural treatments ranged from those manipulated with high chemical inputs and heavily impacted by human management to successional treatments that had no chemicals and little human impact. A canonical discriminant analysis of the nematode data separated the treatments into four systems: high chemical input (the conventional tillage and no tillage treatments, both corn/soybean rotations); organic (the low input and zero input treatments, both wheat/corn/soybean rotations); perennial (poplar and alfalfa treatments); successional (abandoned after tillage and never tilled treatments). Nematode abundance was highest in the high input and organic systems and lowest in the poplar treatment. Overall, bacterial feeding, plant parasitic and fungal feeding nematodes dominated the treatments. Species diversity was greatest in the successional treatments. The bacterial feeding trophic group and the modified Shannon index described differences at both the treatment and system levels, while the Shannon index demonstrated diversity at the system and annual and perennial crop level of analysis. Measures that detected differences (P&lt; 0.05) consistently across all treatments, systems, and annual vs. perennial crops were total abundance, the predator trophic group, the maturity index (MI) and the plant parasite index. The minimum analyses needed to detect disturbance reliably were a multivariate analysis and the MI. However, understanding and predicting the impact of the disturbance on the food web and ecosystem functioning would be increased with results from diversity indices and nematode functional groups. 	1	\N
56	Gage, S. H., S. A. Isard, and M. Colunga-G. 1999. Ecological scaling of aerobiological processes. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 97:249-261.	A variety of organisms change their geographic locations during their life history, and many use the atmosphere to accomplish this shift. Biota that how in the atmosphere range from very small (viruses, bacteria, pollen, and spores) to quite large (weed seeds, aphids, butterflies and moths, songbirds, and waterfowl). As these organisms move, they experience meteorological and ecological conditions that occur at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We present an ecological scaling approach that integrates concepts and elements of spatial and temporal scaling to understanding aerobiology and provide examples of the ecological scales important to the long-distance aerial movement of organisms and associated biological events and processes.  An operational framework for ecological scaling of long distance biota movement is achieved by linking spatially-static ecoregion classification systems with temporally-dynamic measures of vegetation phenology. The ecoregions provide ecological boundaries for the phenological dynamics of plants. Operationally, this approach integrates the bi-weekly vegetation greening indices (NDVI) derived from AVHRR or TM satellite data (representing temporal scaling) with the less dynamic land cover-land use classification (IGBP) and the relatively static ecoregion boundaries (representing the spatial scaling). We argue that the correlation of the life histories of species, especially the timing of take-off to ecosystem phenology through meteorological-based variables and indices (e.g., degree days and moisture indices), allows for dynamic characterization of source ecosystems and can be used to parameterize atmospheric models to forecast the flow of biota in the air. The scale of these processes, the diversity of the types of biota involved in long-distance movement, and the complexity of the processes require systems thinking. We anticipate that this paper will stimulate studies to enhance our understanding of the flow of organisms in the biosphere. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 	1	\N

In situ quantitation of the spatial scale of calling distances and population density-independent N-acylhomoserine lactone-mediated communication by rhizobacteria colonized on plant roots. FEMS Microbial Ecology 56: 188-194. 	We used computer-assisted microscopy at single cell resolution to quantify the in situ spatial scale of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated cell-to-cell communication of Pseudomonas putida colonized on tomato and wheat root surfaces. The results of this in situ quantification study on close-to-natural surfaces challenge the conventional view of a quorum group requirement of high cell densities for this type of bacterial communication. In situ image analysis indicated that the effective 'calling distance' on root surfaces was most frequent at 4-5 mu m, extended to 37 mu m in the root tip/elongation zone and further out to 78 mu m in the root hair zone. The spatial scale of these calling distances is very long-range in proportion to the size of individual bacteria. Geostatistical modeling analysis implicated the importance of AHL-gradients mediating effective communication between remote cells. We conclude that AHL-mediated cell-to-cell communication occurs not only within dense populations, but also in very small groups and over long ranges between individual bacteria, and therefore this cellular activity is more commonplace and effective than hitherto predicted. We propose that this cell-to-cell communication is governed more by the in situ spatial proximity of cells within AHL-gradients than the requirement for a quorum group of high population density. 	1	\N

The CERES-Maize model was developed to investigate how variations in environmental conditions, management decisions, and genetics interact to affect crop development and growth. A tile drainage subroutine was incorporated into CERES-Maize to improve soil-water and nitrogen leaching under subsurface tile drainage conditions. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the soil-water, soil-nitrogen, tile drainage, and tile-nitrogen loss routines of CERES-Maize for file-drained fields in Iowa. An analysis was conducted based on information collected from a study of 36 plots consisting of five management systems during a 4-year period from 1993 to 1996; at Nashua, IA. The model was calibrated for each plot using data from 1994 and 1995, and validated using data from 1993 and 1996. Temporal soil-water contents and water flow from tile drains were calibrated to an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.036 cm(3) cm(-3) and 2.62 cm, respectively, compared to measured values. validation trials gave an average RMSE for soil-water and tile drainage of 0.046 cm(3) cm(-3) and 5.3 cm, respectively. Soil-nitrate and tile-nitrogen flows were calibrated, with an RMSE of 6.27 mu g NO3 g(-1) soil(-1) and 3.21 kg N ha(-1) soil(-1), respectively. For the validation trials, the RMSE for soil-nitrate content and cumulative tile-nitrate flow was 6.82 mu g NO3 g(-1) soil(-1) and 8.8 kg N ha(-1), respectively. These results indicate that the new tile drainage algorithms describe water and nitrate movement reasonably well, which will improve the performance of CERES-Maize for artificially drained fields.

Mycologia 97: 680-694. 	Despite mycologists interest in its unique spore-dispersal mechanism, systematic studies of the genus Sphaerobolus have received little attention. In our previous work multiple gene genealogies indicated the existence of three divergent lineages in the genus Sphaerobolus, each representing a phylogenetic species. Macro- and micromorphological analyses of colony and fruit-body characters presented here confirmed that these three phylogenetic species correspond to two known species, S. iowensis and S. stellatus, and a newly discovered species. In addition, an expanded gene genealogical analysis is presented for the three species. The new species, named Sphaerobolus ingoldii Geml, Davis et Geiser, is described based on both molecular and morphological data. In addition, while S. iowensis previously had been reported in only two localities, we found that it is as common as or more common than S. stellatus in North America. Despite the considerable amount of DNA polymorhism found in all species, nested clade analyses of S. iowensis and S. stellatus indicated little phylogeographic structure in either species, perhaps due to heavy movement mediated by human activities. 	1	\N

Weed community responses were examined in a maize-soybean intercrop, with and without nitrogen fertilization, in southwestern Michigan, USA. Weed suppression was observed when intercropping was additive. The depression in above-ground weed biomass was not due to a synergistic effect of crop diversity, but to the effects of crop density and crop type. Intercropping did not have a greater suppressive effect than monocultures on weed biomass when crop densities were similar to those in monocultures. Intercropping per se did not alter the diversity, species richness or composition of the weed community. The presence and density of maize was more important than soybean density or intercropping itself in affecting the weed community. Fertilization and the interaction between fertilization and crop type had few effects on the weed community. 	1	\N

Fertilization experiments in plant communities are often interpreted in the context of a hump-shaped relationship between species richness and productivity. We analyze results of fertilization experiments from seven terrestrial plant communities representing a productivity gradient (arctic and alpine tundra, two old-field habitats, desert, short- and tall-grass prairie) to determine if the response of species richness to experimentally increased productivity is consistent with the hump-shaped curve. In this analysis, we compared ratios of the mean response in nitrogen-fertilized plots to the mean in control plots for aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and species density (D; number of species per plot of fixed unit area). In general, ANPP increased and plant species density decreased following nitrogen addition, although considerable variation characterized the magnitude of response. We also analyzed a subset of the data limited to the longest running studies at each site (greater than or equal to 4 yr), and found that adding 9 to 13 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (the consistent amount used at all sites) increased ANPP in all communities by approximately 50% over control levels and reduced species density by approximately 30%. The magnitude of response of ANPP and species density to fertilization was independent of initial community productivity. There was as much variation in the magnitude of response among communities within sites as among sites, suggesting community-specific mechanisms of response. Based on these results, we argue that even long-term fertilization experiments are not good predictors of the relationship between species richness and productivity because they are relatively small-scale perturbations whereas the pattern of species richness over natural productivity gradients is influenced by long-term ecological and evolutionary processes. 	1	\N

Environmental Entomology 33: 35-44. 	We used two types of laboratory apparatus to test whether rotation-resistant and wild-type Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) responded differently to corn phenology. Beetles from Nebraska where injury to rotated corn has not been reported were defined as wild type, and beetles from Illinois where injury to rotated corn is common represented &quot;rotation-resistant&quot; populations. A two-chamber emigration arena assayed propensity of both populations to leave corn during and after anthesis. A side-arm olfactometer tested whether the relative attraction of beetles to soybean versus corn was influenced by corn phenology. Beetle origin did not influence departure from corn of varying phenology; both emigrated significantly less from young (shedding pollen) than old (no pollen) corn. Significantly more beetles entered olfactometer chambers with soybean than empty control chambers, but there was no difference in response between the two populations. Numbers of beetles entering chambers with soybean varied with the addition of young versus old corn. Replacing young with old corn approximately doubled the percentage of beetles not selecting corn. As corn aged, adult visitation of soybean increased significantly. We suggest this mechanism is sufficient to explain injury to rotated corn, when linked to a corn crop planted early and synchronously within a landscape limited to corn and soybean. This explanation based on preexisting behavioral plasticity should be given due consideration along with conceptual models of D. v. virgifera rotation resistance that imply genetic change. 	1	\N

Soil Biology and Biochemistry 38: 1172-1176. 	The maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for long-term productivity. Simulation models of SOC dynamics are valuable tools in predicting the impacts of climate on carbon storage and developing management strategies for the mitigation of Greenhouse gas emissions, however, their utility is Generally reduced due to need for specific data. The SOCRATES model is a simple process based representation of soil SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, which requires minimal data inputs and specifically designed to examine the impact of land use and land use change on soil carbon storage. SOCRATES was successful in predicting SOC change at eighteen long-term crop, pasture and forestry trials from North America, Europe and Australasia. These trials ranged from 8 to 86 years in duration, over a wide range of climates and soil types with annual changes in SOC ranging from -3.0 to 4.2%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The immediate effects of tillage on protected soil C and N pools and on trace gas emissions from soils at precultivation levels of native C remain largely unknown. We measured the response to cultivation of CO2 and N2O emissions and associated environmental factors in a previously uncultivated U.S. Midwest Alfisol with C concentrations that were indistinguishable from those in adjacent late successional forests on the same soil type (3.2%). Within 2 days of initial cultivation in 2002, tillage significantly (P=0.001, n=4) increased CO2 fluxes from 91 to 196 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) and within the first 30 days higher fluxes because of cultivation were responsible for losses of 85 g CO2-C m(-2). Additional daily C losses were sustained during a second and third year of cultivation of the same plots at rates of 1.9 and 1.0 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Associated with the CO2 responses were increased soil temperature, substantially reduced soil aggregate size (mean weight diameter decreased 35% within 60 days), and a reduction in the proportion of intraaggregate, physically protected light fraction organic matter. Nitrous oxide fluxes in cultivated plots increased 7.7-fold in 2002, 3.1-fold in 2003, and 6.7-fold in 2004 and were associated with increased soil NO3- concentrations, which approached 15 mu g N g(-1). Decreased plant N uptake immediately after tillage, plus increased mineralization rates and fivefold greater nitrifier enzyme activity, likely contributed to increased NO3- concentrations. Our results demonstrate that initial cultivation of a soil at precultivation levels of native soil C immediately destabilizes physical and microbial processes related to C and N retention in soils and accelerates trace gas fluxes. Policies designed to promote long-term C sequestration may thus need to protect soils from even occasional cultivation in order to preserve sequestered C. 	1	\N

Understanding the effects of tillage on soils following years or decades of no-till is critical for developing C conservation strategies. To date, short-term responses to tillage in previously uncultivated or other long-term no-till soils have primarily focused on total C changes, which are difficult to detect. Tillage effects on soil conservation and C permanence may be better predicted by changes in more readily detected factors known to affect C storage such as aggregation and physically protected C. We annually plowed replicated plots in a previously uncultivated midsuccessional field between 2002 and 2004 and investigated changes in the distribution of aggregates, physically protected C, and light fraction (LF) organic matter. Within 60 d of initial cultivation, soil aggregates in the 2000- to 8000-mu m size class declined from 0.47 to 0.15 g g(-1) at 0- to 7-cm soil depth and from 0.32 to 0.23 g g(-1) at 7 to 20 cm. Lower levels of aggregation persisted through the winter and spring of the following year. Inter-aggregate, unprotected light fraction (LF) increased following cultivation, as did particulate C in soil fractions with densities &lt; 1.9 g cm(-3). Changes in the mass of total soil C were not detectable after 3 yr but the vertical distribution of all soil C pools was altered by plowing. Our study demonstrates that plowing once immediately and substantially alters aggregation and LF and particulate C dynamics and that these conditions persist. Results suggest that no-till soils need to be continuously maintained to protect aggregation and physically stabilized C pools. 	1	\N

Journal of Ecology 83: 357-367.	1 Spatial variability in soil nitrogen and moisture levels was determined using a geostatistical analysis in a newly abandoned field, a mid-late successional field and a second-growth forest in south-western Michigan.  2 A greater proportion of the total variation for all variates associated with nitrogen availability was spatially dependent in the mid-successional field; the newly abandoned field and forest had similar patterns of spatial dependence in these variates. 3 The distance (range) over which there was spatial dependence was greater in the mid-successional field than the other two communities, indicating a more coarse-grained pattern of spatial heterogeneity in soil nitrogen, particularly in the surface soils (0-5 cm), than in the other two sites. 4 Examination of patterns of spatial dependence using different lag intervals generally gave similar results; though a nested pattern of NO3-N availability in the mid-successional field was detected at a finer scale of analysis, indicating spatial variation at multiple scales. 5 The results suggest that patterns of spatial variation in soil nitrogen change over time in successional plant communities, perhaps reflecting changes in the species composition or size of individual plants in these communities. 	1	\N

Differences among plant species in morphology and patterns of growth are assumed to influence their ability to acquire resources and, consequently, their competitive ability. Despite the acknowledged importance of below-ground resources for plant growth, our knowledge of species differences in root morphology of non-agricultural plants is limited. Comparisons of root morphology, growth rate and topology of seedlings of 12 herbaceous plant species that occur in early to mid-successional fields revealed significant differences among species that were largely related to life history. Annuals grew faster and produced longer and more branched roots than did biennials and perennials. Only among the annuals was there a positive correlation between seed mass and root growth. The grasses allocated proportionately more biomass to roots than the dicots, but did not differ in root length or branching pattern. As seedlings, all 12 species exhibited a herringbone topology; although after 10 d there were significant differences in topology between annuals and perennials indicating that the annuals had begun to develop a more dichotomously branched root system. The possible effects of early differences in root morphology among life-history types in acquiring soil resources in heterogeneous and successional environments are discussed. 	1	\N

Proliferation of roots in a nutrient patch can occur either as a result of an increase in root length (morphological response) or by a change in root birth or death rates (demographic responses). In this study we attempted to distinguish between these two mechanisms of response to nutrient patches and to compare the responses of four old-field plant species (two annuals, two perennials). For all four species combined, there were significant increases in root numbers and root length in fertilized patches. Root proliferation in fertilized patches was largely due to increased birth ( = branching) rates of new roots. However, there was also a significant increase in root death rates in the fertilized patches which reduced the magnitude of the increase in net root numbers. Plots for individual species suggested they differed in the magnitude and timing of root proliferation in fertilized patches due to differences in root birth and death rates. However, because of the limited sample size in this study, there was only a marginally significant difference among species in root birth rates, and no difference in death rates. Further studies are currently underway to better quantify species differences in the demographic mechanism, as well as magnitude, of response to nutrient patches and if this would affect the ability to exploit small-scale heterogeneity in soil resources. 	1	\N

A major challenge in evaluating patterns of species richness and productivity involves acquiring data to examine these relationships empirically across a range of ecologically significant spatial scales. In this paper, we use data from herb-dominated plant communities at six Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to examine how the relationship between plant species density and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) differs when the spatial scale of analysis is changed. We quantified this relationship at different spatial scales in which we varied the focus and extent of analysis: (1) among fields within communities, (2) among fields within biomes or biogeographic regions, and (3) among communities within biomes or biogeographic regions. We used species density (D = number of species per m(2)) as our measure of diversity to have a comparable index across all sites and scales. Although we expected unimodal relationships at all spatial scales, we found that spatial scale influenced the form of the relationship. At the scale of fields within different grassland communities, we detected a significant relationship at only one site (Minnesota old-fields), and it was negative linear. When we expanded the extent of analyses to biogeographic regions (grasslands or North America), we found significant unimodal relationships in both cases. However, when we combined data to examine patterns among community types within different biogeographic regions (grassland, alpine tundra, arctic tundra, or North America), we did not detect significant relationships between species density and ANPP for any region. The results of our analyses demonstrate that the spatial scale of analysis - how data are aggregated and patterns examined can influence the form of the relationship between species density and productivity. It also demonstrates the need for data sets from a broad spectrum of sites sampled over a range of scales for examining challenging and controversial ecological hypotheses. 	1	\N
71	Gross, K. L. 1990. A comparison of methods for estimating soil seed banks. Journal of Ecology 78: 1079-1093.	(1) Seed-bank species composition and seed density were determined in an annually ploughed field at the Kellogg Biological Station in south-western Michigan, U.S.A. using three different methods: direct germination, germination following cold-stratification, and washing using a modified elutriation system. A fourth method, flotation on a salt-density gradient was abandoned after preliminary trials showed it was inefficient and inaccurate.  (2) Twenty soil cores (2.5 cm in diameter, 15 cm deep) were taken from each of twenty-five sampling points in the field. Cores were divided into three depth intervals (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm and 5-15 cm) and five cores from each quarter of a sampling quadrat were combined and randomly assigned to one of the four methods for estimating the seed bank. (3) A total of fifty species was detected in the seed bank of this community. Overall, more species were detected with cold-stratification (forty-two species) than with direct germination (thirty-seven) or elutriation (thirty-five). Plots of species-sampling-area curves showed that fifteen to twenty sampling locations were sufficient to determine the number of species present in the seed bank with any of these methods. (4) Seed-density estimates were significantly higher in the elutriated samples. This was due primarily to the inclusion of inviable seeds in the counts from the elutriated samples. (5) There were significant differences in seed viability among species recovered in the elutriated samples. Both Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Chenopodium album, seeds of which were common in the samples, had low viability (25% and 3%, respectively). (6) Germination methods (particularly when more than one pre-treatment method is used) provide a more complete listing of species present in the soil seed bank of a community than elutriation. However, elutriation methods may be more useful for documenting variation in seed distributions on a large spatial scale or in quantifying the distribution of species with unique, easily identifiable seeds. Elutriation seems particularly well-suited for quantifying the distribution of plants that are considered weeds in agricultural systems, because many of these species have seeds that are easily identified and retain viability when dried. 	1	\N

The system provided reliable estimates of seed densities for weed species with a broad range of seed weights (0.06 to 9.80 mg) and had no effect on seed viability of three weed species tested. Elutriation of soil samples (up to 60 g) taken from a cultivated field took approximately 15 min. Separating, classifying, and counting seeds is time consuming (20 to 30 min per sample) but provides an accurate estimate of seed densities for weeds with a diameter of 0.5 mm or more.  &copy; Weed Science Society of America 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60: 2483-2493.	We determined the accuracy and reproducibility of whole-community fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis with two model bacterial communities differing in composition by using the Microbial ID, Inc. (MIDI), system. The biomass, taxonomic structure, and expected MIDI-FAME profiles under a variety of environmental conditions were known for these model communities a priori. Not all members of each community could be detected in the composite profile because of lack of fatty acid ''signatures'' in some isolates or because of variations (approximately fivefold) in fatty acid yield across taxa. MIDI-FAME profiles of replicate subsamples of a given community were similar in terms of fatty acid yield per unit of community dry weight and relative proportions of specific fatty acids. Principal-components analysis (PCA) of MIDI-FAME profiles resulted in a clear separation of the two different communities and a clustering of replicates of each community from two separate experiments on the first PCA axis. The first PCA axis accounted for 57.1% of the variance in the data and was correlated with fatty acids that varied significantly between communities and reflected the underlying community taxonomic structure. On the basis of our data, community fatty acid profiles can be used to assess the relative similarities and differences of microbial communities that differ in taxonomic composition. However, detailed interpretation of community fatty acid profiles in terms of biomass or community taxonomic composition must be viewed with caution until our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative distribution of fatty acids over a wide variety of taxa and the effects of growth conditions on fatty acid profiles is more extensive. 	1	\N

Analysis of factors affecting the accuracy, reproducibility, and interpretation of microbial community carbon source utilization patterns. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 61: 1458-1468.	We determined factors that affect responses of bacterial isolates and model bacterial communities to the 95 carbon substrates in Biolog microtiter plates. For isolates and communities of three to six bacterial strains, substrate oxidation rates were typically nonlinear and were delayed by dilution of the inoculum. When inoculum density was controlled, patterns of positive and negative responses exhibited by microbial communities to each of the carbon sources were reproducible. Rates and extents of substrate oxidation by the communities were also reproducible but were not simply the sum of those exhibited by community members when tested separately. Replicates of the same model community clustered when analyzed by principal-components analysis (PCA), and model communities with different compositions were clearly separated on the first PCA axis, which accounted for &gt;60% of the dataset variation, PCA discrimination among different model communities depended on the extent to which specific substrates were oxidized, However, the substrates interpreted by PCA to be most significant in distinguishing the communities changed with reading time, reflecting the nonlinearity of substrate oxidation rates. Although whole-community substrate utilization profiles were reproducible signatures for a given community, the extent of oxidation of specific substrates and the numbers or activities of microorganisms using those substrates in a given community were not correlated. Replicate soil samples varied significantly in the rate and extent of oxidation of seven tested substrates, suggesting microscale heterogeneity in composition of the soil microbial community. 	1	\N

The Great Lakes Entomologist 31: 49-57. 	Neonate tiger swallowtail larvae (Papilio glaucus) were used to bioassay the effects of Btk (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki) at 4 doses (0.268, 0.034, 0.008, and 0.004 BIU per cm2 leaf surface) with an untreated control. Larvae, obtained from females captured in Georgia and North Carolina, were fed leaves of either tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipfera) or black cherry (Prunus serotina) in experiments that either included a pre-treatment dip and rinse in 5% chlorox bleach or not, before the application of Btk (dipping leaves in serially diluted solutions of Foray 48B). The results show no difference between North Carolina and Georgia P. glaucus larval dosage sensitivities, but do illustrate a clear dosage effect for all 4 treatments (cherry with and without bleach pre-treatment; tulip tree with and without bleach pre-treatment). The larvae on the bleached leaves do not do better (for cherry or tulip tree host plant) as would be expected if microbial symbionts on the phylloplane synergize the Btk toxicity. These results show that Btk (at doses several thousand-fold less than aerial sprays across forests for gypsy moth control) will kill P. glaucus, with or without microbial synergism on leaf phylloplanes. 	1	\N

Nitrogen uptake and transformation in a midwestern U.S. stream: A stable isotope enrichment study. Biogeochemistry 54: 297-340. 	This study presents a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen (N) cycling in a second-order forested stream in southern Michigan that has moderately high concentrations of ammonium (mean, 16 mug N/L) and nitrate (17 mug N/L). A whole-stream (NH4+)-N-15 addition was performed for 6 weeks in June and July, and the tracer N-15 was measured downstream in ammonium, nitrate, and detrital and living biomass. Ancillary measurements included biomass of organic matter, algae, bacteria and fungi, nutrient concentrations, hydraulic characteristics, whole-stream metabolism, and nutrient limitation assays. The results provide insights into the heterotrophic nature of woodland streams and reveal the rates at which biological processes alter nitrogen transport through stream systems.  Ammonium uptake lengths were 766-1349 m and uptake rates were 41-60 mug N m(-2) min(-1). Nitrate uptake could not be detected. Nitrification rates were estimated from the downstream increase in N-15-enriched nitrate using a simulation model. The ammonium was removed by nitrification (57% of total uptake), heterotrophic bacteria and fungi associated with detritus (29%), and epilithic algae (14%). Growth of algae was likely limited by light rather than nutrients, and dissolved O-2 revealed that the stream metabolism was heterotrophic overall (P:R = 0.2). Incubations of detritus in darkened chambers showed that uptake of N-15 was mostly heterotrophic. Microbial N in detritus and algal N in epilithon appeared to reach isotopic steady state with the dissolved ammonium, but the isotopic enrichment of the bulk detritus and epilithon did not approach that of ammonium, probably due to a large fraction of organic N in the bulk samples that was not turning over. The actively cycling fraction of total N in organic compartments was estimated from the isotopic enrichment, assuming uptake of ammonium but not nitrate, to be 23% for epilithon, 1% for fine benthic organic matter, 5% for small woody debris, and 7% for leaves. These percentages agree with independent estimates of epilithic algal biomass, which were based on carbon:chlorophyll ratios in bulk samples and in algal fractions separated by density-gradient centrifugation in colloidal silica, and of microbial N in the detritus, which were based on N released by chloroform fumigations. 	1	\N

The role of in-stream vs. allochthonous N in stream food webs: Modeling the results of a nitrogen isotope addition experiment. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 23: 429-448. 	Stable isotope enrichment experiments offer a potentially powerful way to examine the base of aquatic food webs, but interpretation of the data from these experiments may be confounded by problems such as selective ingestion/assimilation of bulk food sources by consumers, variable tracer enrichment over time, and the failure of consumers to approach isotopic equilibrium with the tracer in their diets over the course of the experiment. Our study examined data from a stable isotope addition experiment in which N-15-labeled NH4+ was added to a midwestern US stream. A compartment model was used to provide insights into the kinetics of N-15 uptake and release from algae, heterotrophic microbes colonizing detritus, and invertebrate consumers. The model accounted for temporal variation in the degree of isotopic enrichment and did not require the assumption of isotopic eqilibrium between consumers and their diets. The importance of instream production (i.e., growth of algae and microbes within the study reach during the experiment) relative to allochthonous and upstream inputs was similar to38 to 50% for heptageniids and Psephenus, 10 to 20% for Orconectes propinquus, Gammarus, hydropsychids, and larval Stenelmis, and &lt;10% for the filter-feeding Similium and the unionid mussel Pleurobema sintoxia. The alternative choices of algae or heterotrophic microbes as the basis of consumer diets made little difference in these estimates, even though the microbes became more IN-enriched than the algae because microbes had higher turnover rates. These results were subject to a number of caveats, and guidelines for experimental design are suggested for future studies to help address some of these problems. 	1	\N

American Journal of Horticulture Science 127: 136-142. 	Highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) are long lived perennial plants that are grown on acidic Soils. The goal of this study was to determine how blueberry cultivation might influence the nitrification capacity of acidic soils by comparing the nitrification potential of blueberry soils to adjacent noncultivated forest soils. The net nitrification potential of blueberry and forest soils was compared by treating soils with N-15 enriched (NH4)(2)SO4, and monitoring nitrate (NO3--N) production during a 34-day incubation period in plastic bags at 18 degreesC. Net nitrification was also compared by an aerobic slurry method. Autotrophic nitrifiers were quantified by the most probable number method. Nitrate production from labeled ammonium ((NH4+)-N-15) indicated that nitrification was more rapid in blueberry soils than in forest soils from six of the seven study sites. Slurry nitrification assays provided similar results. Blueberry soils also contained higher numbers of nitrifying bacteria compared to forest soils. Nitrification in forest soils did not appear to be limited by availability of NH4+ substrate. Results suggest that blueberry production practices lead to greater numbers of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and increased nitrification capacity, possibly resulting from annual application of ammonium containing fertilizers. 	1	\N

Relying more on biological N2 fixation has been suggested as a way to meet one of the major challenges of agricultural sustainability. A N-15 study was conducted to compare the fate of applied legume and fertilizer N in a long-term cropping systems experiment. Nitrogen-15-labeled red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and (NH4)2SO4 were applied to microplots within the low-input and conventional cropping systems of the Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research Center in Pennsylvania. The N-15 was applied to soil and traced into corn (Zea mays L.) in 1987 and 1988. Residual N-15 was also traced into second-year spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Legume and fertilizer N-15 remaining in soil was measured and loss of N was calculated by difference. More fertilizer than legume N was recovered by crops (40 vs. 17% of input), more legume than fertilizer N was retained in soil (47 vs. 17% of input), and similar amounts of N from both sources were lost from the cropping systems (39% of input) over the 2-yr period. More fertilizer than legume N was lost during the year of application (38 vs. 18% of input), but more legume than fertilizer N was lost the year after application (17 vs. 4% of input). Residual fertilizer and legume N-15 was distributed similarly among soil fractions. Soil microbial biomass was larger in the legume-based system. A larger, but not necessarily more active, soil microbial biomass was probably responsible for the greater soil N supplying capacity in the legume-based compared with fertilizer-based system. 	1	\N
80	Harris, D., R. P. Voroney, and E. A. Paul. 1997. Measurement of microbial biomass C:N ratio by chloroform fumigation incubation. Canadian Journal of Soil Science 77: 507-514.	We present a calculation for soil microbial biomass N:C ratio determined from a 10-d incubation following chloroform fumigation. The calculation is based on a mathematical model of the N content of the pre- and post-fumigation soil microbial biomass and the growth yield of the biomass that develops after fumigation. Biomass N is calculated from the N:C ratio and biomass C. The mineralization of bacteria and fungi, with different N contents, added to fumigated soils was used to establish the model parameters. The model was tested against an independent set of measurements and considers two assumptions: 1) The ratio of N:C mineralized from killed biomass is equal to the ratio of N:C mineralized from soil non-biomass constituents. 2) More realistically, the N and C mineralization in the fumigated soil, from sources other than killed biomass, is a residual fraction of the N and C mineralization in the unfumigated soil. Biomass C:N ratios calculated without a control correction (assumption 1) were, on average, 20% wider than corrected values (assumption 2). Biomass N calculated as the product of N:C and biomass C was compared with published values for several data sets. The new calculation method was robust even when net immobilization of N followed fumigation. 	1	\N
81	Harris, D., and E. A. Paul. 1994. Measurement of microbial growth rates in soil. Applied Soil Ecology 1: 277-290. 	Measurements of the average growth rates of soil bacteria from a soil under three treatments; a conventional high input corn soybean rotation, a reversion to a native successional community (4 years) and a never ploughed grassland, were made by two methods. The specific rates of synthesis of bacterial DNA were determined from the specific activities of the DNA precursor, deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), and purified bacterial community DNA after 3H thymidine incorporation. These rates were compared with the specific respiration rates of the soil microbiota determined from the initial rate of C mineralization and the microbial biomass C. We show how these two measurements can be used to estimate values for microbial growth yield and maintenance coefficients in soil. Both methods ranked the soil treatments in the same order. The reversion treatment had the highest thymidine incorporation and specific respiration rates and the corn soybean rotation the lowest. The grassland soil had the highest microbial biomass but an intermediate growth rate. Based on thymidine incorporation the doubling time of the bacterial biomass at 25&deg;C was 160 days in soil from the corn soybean rotation and 107 days in the reversion treatment. Fractionation of the 3H-labelled DNA according to its %guanine+cytosine content showed growth of soil bacteria to be widespread among bacterial genera and not confined to a few active species. The soil bacterial growth rates found inre are much lower than those found in some other studies using thymidine incorporation but are in agreement with annual C budgets for the soils. 	1	\N

Landscape and Urban Planning 49: 25-34. 	Development of integrated ecological indicators for assessment of the condition of altered watersheds is fundamental to sound policy and decision making in water resource management. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for developing and integrating a set of hydrological and biologic indicators that can show the modified spatial and temporal distributions of hydrological and biological conditions which result from land use/cover changes across the study watersheds by using Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, multiple physical and biological databases, and simulation models. Effects of management practices and programs can be evaluated by comparing the temporal distributions of these indicators over a certain period. The paper further outlines steps needed to bridge the gaps between the largely physical and structural aspects of research on watershed indicators and the work on biological processes and indicators of ecosystems for integrating these indicators into watershed planning and management processes.

We examined the effects of plant age and root age on mycorrhizal colonization in the obligate mycotrophic grass Andropogon gerardii grown at high and low rates of soil phosphorus availability. There were significant interactions between soil P availability, plant age: root age and mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization of 1-week-old roots increased with plant age, but was not significantly affected by soil P availability. Colonization of roots increased significantly with increasing root age only in the low-P treatment. Although the high-P treatment increased rates of root extension for some root age classes, there were not consistently lower rates of colonization in these roots. Studies of P acquisition by A. gerardii and other mycotrophic plants should take these interacting factors into account, especially when examining exploitation of nutrient-enriched patches.

Gene probe analysis of soil microbial populations selected by amendment with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Applied Environment Microbiology 58: 3941-3948.	Soils with a history of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) treatment at field application rates and control soils with no prior exposure to 2,4-D were amended with 2,4-D in the laboratory. Before and during these treatments, the populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria were monitored by most-probable-number (MPN) enumeration and hybridization analyses, using probes for the tfd genes of plasmid pJP4, which encode enzymes for 2,4-D degradation. Data obtained by these alternate methods were compared. Several months after the most recent field application of 2,4-D (approximately 1 ppm), soils with a 42-year history of 2,4-D treatment did not have significantly higher numbers of 2,4-D-degrading organisms than did control soils with no prior history of treatment. In response to laboratory amendments with 2,4-D, both the previously treated soils and those with no prior history of exposure exhibited a dramatic increase in the number of 2,4-D-metabolizing organisms. The MPN data indicate a 4- to 5-log population increase after one amendment with 250 ppm of 2,4-D and ultimately a 6- to 7-log increase after four additional amendments, each with 400 ppm of 2,4-D. Similarly, when total bacterial DNA from the soil microbial community of these samples was analyzed by using a probe for the tfdA gene (2,4-D monooxygenase) or the tfdB gene (2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase) a dramatic increase in the level of hybridization was observed in both soils. Probes to the tfdC, -D, -E, and -F genes did not hybridize to the bacterial community DNA to any significant extent before or after 2,4-D treatment, indicating that pathways different from the canonical pJP4-encoded pathway at the DNA sequence level, and possibly at the functional level, account for the degradative activity in these soils. Quantitative hybridization data and MPN values were in agreement, indicating that most of the 2,4-D-degrading populations were detected by the tfdA and tfdB gene probes. The hybridization patterns detected in Southern analyses of bacterial community DNA indicated that a dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was selected and maintained in these soils. 	1	\N

The aim of this paper is to clarify the effect of soil aggregation on physical and chemical properties of structured soils both on a bulk soil scale, for single aggregates, as well as for homogenized material. Aggregate formation and aggregate strength depend on swelling and shrinkage processes and on biological activity and kinds of organic exudates as well as on the intensity, number and time of swelling and drying events. Such aggregates are more dense than the bulk soil. The intra-aggregate pore distribution consists not only of finer pores, but these are also more tortuous. Therefore, water fluxes in aggregated soils are mostly multidimensional and the corresponding water fluxes in the intra-aggregate pore system are much smaller. Furthermore, ion transport both by mass flow and diffusion are delayed, whereby the length of the follow path in such tortuous finer pores further retards chemical exchange processes. The rearrangement of particles by aggregate formation also induces an increased apparent thermal diffusivity as compared with the homogenized material. The aggregate formation also affects the aeration and the gaseous composition in the intra-aggregate pore space. Depending on the kind and intensity of aggregation, the intra-aggregate pores can be completely anoxic, while the inter-aggregate pores are already completely aerated. The possibility to predict physical properties on these various scales depends on the rigidity of the pore system. In general, this rigidity depends on the above-mentioned physical and chemical processes both with respect to intensity and frequency. Thus, aggregates like subangular block or plates are the most rigid systems, while physical processes in the seedbed cannot be modelled using existing approaches due to the low strength and consequent instability of the pore system.

Defining a realistic control for the chloroform fumigation incubation method using microscopic counting and 14C substrates. Canadian Journal of Soil Science 76: 459-467.	Chloroform fumigation-incubation (CPI) has made possible the extensive characterization of soil microbial biomass carbon (C) (MBC). Defining the non-microbial C mineralized in soils following fumigation remains the major limitation of CFI. The mineralization of non-microbial C during CFI was examined by adding C-14-maize to soil before incubation. The decomposition of the C-14-maize during a 10-d incubation after fumigation was 22.5% that in non-fumigated control soils. Re-inoculation of the fumigated soil raised C-14-maize decomposition to 73% that of the unfumigated control. A method was developed which varies the proportion of mineralized C from the unfumigated soil (UFC) that is subtracted in calculating CFI biomasss C. The proportion subtracted (P) varies according to a linear function of the ratio of C mineralized in the fumigated (F-C) and unfumigated samples (F-C/UFC) with two parameters K-1 and K-2 (P = K-1 F-C/UFC) + K-2). These parameters were estimated by regression of CFI biomass C, calculated according to the equation MBC = (F-C - PUFC)/0.41, against that derived by direct microscopy in a series of California soils. Parameter values which gave the best estimate of microscopic biomass from the fumigation data were K-1 = 0.29 and K-2 = 0.23 (R(2) = 0.87). Substituting these parameter values, the equation can be simplified to MBC = 1.73 F-C - 0.56UF(C). The equation was applied to other CFI data to determine its effect on the measurement of MBC. The use of this approach corrected data that were previously difficult to interpret and helped to reveal temporal trends and changes in MBC associated with soil depth. 	1	\N

Most N-15 dilution techniques disturb either the soil or N-pool size. The objective of this study was to develop a method of labeling the roots of Populus trees with N-15 without physically disturbing the soil. Such a method would enable the direct measurement of the flux of N-15 from dead roots into the soil organic matter. Leaf and root biomass were labeled by injection of N-15 directly into the vessel elements of hybrid Populus trees during their second growing season. The N-15 was uniformly distributed throughout the canopy and root system. The rate and amount of N-15 turnover from plant tissue can be determined by pool transfer or through differences in plant N-15 concentrations. The N-15 was detected in the dead-root pool 8 wk after injection, indicating root turnover. Results demonstrate the ability to measure the contribution of fine-root litter to N-cycling processes without disturbing the soil environment. 	1	\N

We studied whole-tree C allocation with special emphasis on the quantification of C allocations to roots and root respiration. To document seasonal patterns of C allocation, 2-year-old hybrid poplar trees greater than 3 m tall were labeled with CO(2)C-14 in a large Plexiglas chamber in the field, in July and September. Climate and CO2 concentration were controlled to track ambient conditions during labeling. Individual tree canopy CO2 assimilation averaged 3.8 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 (12.9 g C day-1 tree-1) in July and 6.2 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 (9.8 g C day-1 tree-1) in September. Aboveground dark respiration was 12% of net daytime C fixation in July and 15% in September. Specific activity of root-soil respiration peaked 2 days after labeling and stabilized to less than 5% of maximum 2 weeks later. Low specific activity of root-soil respiration and a labeled pool of root C demonstrated that current photosynthate was the primary source of C for root growth and maintenance during the growing season. Root respiration averaged 20% of total soil respiration in both July and September based on the proportion of labeled C respired to labeled C fixed. In July, 80% of the recovered C-14 was found above ground and closely resembled the weight distribution of the growing shoot. By September, 51% of the recovered C-14 was in the root system and closely resembled the weight distribution of different size classes of roots. The finding that the distribution of biomass and C-14 were similar verified that the C introduced during labeling followed normal seasonal translocation pathways. Results are compared to smaller scale labeling studies and the suitability of the approach for studying long-term C fluxes is discussed. 	1	\N

Journal of Ecology 86:794-803.	1 We examined the impact of nitrogen addition on early successional dynamics and plant species diversity in replicate plots of an old-field succession treatment in south-western Michigan, USA, for 7 years following abandonment from agriculture.  2 Nitrogen addition significantly increased above-ground plant biomass, but had no effect on the displacement or persistence of different life-history groups. Annual species made up a similar proportion of community biomass and decreased at equivalent rates in control and nitrogen-addition microplots. Perennial species biomass increased at similar rates in the control and nitrogen-addition microplots. 3 Annual species dominated initially, but declined in abundance over the first 4 years and were replaced by biennials and then herbaceous perennials. The resulting high numbers of species losses and gains were not affected by nitrogen addition. 4 Nitrogen addition did not affect mean species density or the Shannon index of diversity. There was also no temporal change in the similarity of species composition between control and nitrogen-addition microplots, indicating that nitrogen addition did not cause divergence over time in community composition. In year 7, similar species dominated the nitrogen-addition and control microplots, but there were differences in species composition and abundance of the subordinate species in each community. 5 Only in year 6 of this study was there a significant negative relationship between community biomass and the Shannon diversity index. There was no significant relationship between community biomass and species density in any of the first 7 years following abandonment. Thus, the community response to increased biomass due to nitrogen addition was expressed primarily through changes in community structure, not richness. 6 The effects of nitrogen addition on the early successional dynamics, species composition and consequently diversity of a plant community may depend on initial site conditions. The response to nitrogen enrichment may be slower in sites such as ours with fertile soils that become dominated by herbaceous perennial dicots. 	1	\N
91	Jame, Y. W., H. W. Cutforth, and J. T. Ritchie. 1999. Temperature response function for leaf appearance rate in wheat and corn. Canadian Journal of Plant Science 79: 1-10.	The ability to predict leaf appearance would enhance our capability of modeling plant development and the rate of leaf area expansion. Many crop models use the constant thermal time for successive leaf tip appearance (which is often termed a phyllochron) as one model parameter to predict total number of leaves and date of anthesis. However, many researchers have found that phyllochron is not constant, but is dependent upon environment. The problem could be related to the simplified assumption that the daily leaf appearance rate is linearly related to temperature (and hence, phyllochron is constant, independent of temperature). In reality, the temperature response function for the development of a biological system is nonlinear. Thus, we fitted daily leaf appearance rate-temperature relationships obtained from growth room studies for both wheat (Triticum aestivum) and corn (Zea mays L.) to a nonlinear beta function with 0 degrees C as the base temperature and 42 degrees C as the upper critical temperature. The function described the relationships very well over the full range of temperatures for plant development. Other variables that are used to describe the duration and rate of leaf appearance, such as calendar days, phyllochron, and thermal rate of leaf appearance, are related to the daily leaf appearance rate, eliminating the need to develop various mathematical functions to independently describe the response of these variables to temperature. Because of the nonlinear nature of the temperature response function, we demonstrated that more accurate determinations of daily leaf appearance rates can be achieved by calculating rates over relatively short periods (i.e., hourly) and summing these to get the mean daily rate. Many environmental factors other than temperature also affect leaf appearance rate. However, once the proper temperature response function for leaf appearance rate is determined, it is much easier to determine when and how other factors are involved to modify the leaf appearance rate under a given environment. 	1	\N

Ecology 84: 1895-1908.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are integral components of grasslands because most plants are associated with interconnected networks of AM hyphae. Mycorrhizae generally facilitate plant uptake of nutrients from the soil. However, mycorrhizal associations are known to vary in their mutualistic function, and there is currently no metric that links AM functioning with fungal colonization of roots. Mycorrhizal structures differ in their physiological and ecological functioning, so changes in AM allocation to intraradical (inside roots) and extraradical (in soil) structures may signal shifts in mycorrhizal function. We hypothesize that the functional equilibrium model applies to AM fungi and that fertilization should reduce allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae, the fungal structures that are directly involved in nutrient acquisition and transfer to plants. This study compared AM responses to experimental N enrichment at five grasslands distributed across North America. Samples were collected from replicated N-enriched (and some P-enriched) and control plots throughout the growing season for three years. Intraradical AM structures were measured in over 1400 root samples, extraradical hyphal density was measured in over 590 soil samples, and spore biovolume was analyzed in over 400 soil samples. There were significant site X N interactions for spore biovolume, extraradical hyphae, intraradical hyphae, and vesicles. Nitrogen enrichment strongly decreased AM structures at Cedar Creek, the site with the lowest soil N:P, and it increased AM structures at Konza Prairie, the site with the highest soil N:P. As predicted by the functional equilibrium model, in soils with sufficient P, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae was generally reduced by N enrichment. Allocation to spores and hyphae was most sensitive to fertilization. At the mesic sites, this response was associated with a shift in the relative abundance of Gigasporaceae within AM fungal communities. This study demonstrates that N enrichment impacts mycorrhizal allocation across a wide range of grassland ecosystems. Such changes are important because they suggest an alteration in mycorrhizal functioning that, in turn, may impact plant community composition and ecosystem function.	1	\N

In the mid-1970s, Hynes (1975) wrote eloquently about the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial systems. Central theories in stream ecology developed thereafter have dealt with the longitudinal flow of energy, materials and organisms in streams, and, with the exception of the flood pulse concept (Junk, Bayley &amp; Sparks, 1989), have largely ignored areas outside the riparian zone. The structure of the upland and activities occurring there play a more important part than previously recognized in regulating community structure and ecosystem processes in streams.  2. These new perspectives are made possible by developments in hierarchy theory, patch dynamics, and the refinement of tools used to quantify spatial and temporal heterogeneity. 3. Geographical information systems (GIS), image processing technology and spatial statistical techniques allow quantitative assessment of lateral, longitudinal and vertical components of the landscape that interact at several spatial and temporal scales to influence streams. When GIS is used in concert with geostatistics, multivariate statistics, or landscape models, complex relationships can be elucidated and predicted. 4. To a certain extent, the tools discussed above have only automated functions that were previously performed manually. This suite of tools has improved the ability of aquatic ecologists to examine relationships and test theories over larger, more heterogeneous regions than were previously possible. 5. At the local, state and federal level, management and regulatory frameworks are currently being re-evaluated to incorporate this new perspective in resource management and policy decision making. 6. We will discuss current and future trends in technologies and tools used for aquatic ecosystem research, and the use of techniques as they are applied in these regional assessments are also discussed. 	1	\N

Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 53: 253-257. 	Early in the growing season, an adequate level of mineralized soil N is essential in order to obtain optimum corn (Zea mays L.) growth and productivity. In Michigan, soil N sufficiency is often determined using the pre-sidedress nitrate test (PSNT) at stage V-6 of corn growth. The Living Field Laboratory (LFL) is a long-term cropping systems experiment, estestablished 1993 at Hickory Corners, MI. The design is a split-block within a split-plot. Main plots are commercial fertilizer vs. daily manure compost as a nutrient source. Sub-plots are the entry points in a corn-corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation, and continuous corn. These ave further split so that each entry point is grown with or without an overseeded cover crop. By 1995, the third year of the rotation, rotation as well as cover crop influenced the rate of N mineralization at PSNT sampling Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) residue following wheat provided both the earliest and highest amount of mineralization, and the highest yield for a succeeding corn crop. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60: 1106-1115.	Forty-seven numerically dominant 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading bacteria were isolated at different times from 1989 through 1992 from eight agricultural plots (3.6 by 9.1 m) which were either not treated with 2,4-D or treated with 2,4-D at three different concentrations. Isolates were obtained from the most dilute positive most-probable-number tubes inoculated with soil samples from the different plots on seven sampling dates over the 3-year period. The isolates were compared by using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles, chromosomal patterns obtained by PCR amplification of repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences, and hybridization patterns obtained with probes for the tfd genes of plasmid pJP4 and a probe (Spa probe) that detects a distinctly different 2,4-D-degrading isolate, Sphingomonas paucimobilis (formerly Pseudomonas paucimobilis). A total of 57% of the isolates were identified to the species level by the FAME analysis, and these isolates were strains of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, or Alcaligenes species. Hybridization analysis revealed four groups. Group I strains, which exhibited sequence homology with tfdA, -B, -C, and -D genes, were rather diverse, as determined by both the FAME analysis and the REP-PCR analysis. Group II, which exhibited homology only with the tfdA gene, was a small group and was probably a subset of group I. All group I and II strains had plasmids. Hybridization analysis revealed that the tfd genes were located on plasmids in 75% of these strains and on the chromosome or a large plasmid in the other 25% of the strains. One strain exhibited tfdA and -B hybridization associated with a plasmid band, while tfdC and -D hybridized with the chromosomal band area. The group III strains exhibited no detectable homology to tfd genes but hybridized to the Spa probe. The members of this group were tightly clustered as determined by both the FAME analysis and the REP-PCR analysis, were distinctly different from group I strains as determined by the FAME analysis, and had very few plasmids; this group contained more of the 47 isolates than any other group. The group III strains were identified as S. paucimobilis. The group IV strains, which hybridized to neither the tfd probe nor the Spa probe, were as diverse as the group I strains as determined by the FAME and REP-PCR analyses. Most of group IV strains could not be identified by the FAME analysis. Strains belonging to groups I and III were more frequently recovered from soils that had greater field exposure to 2,4-D, suggesting that they were the best competitors for 2,4-D under field conditions. The selection regimen which we used led to two successful but dissimilar groups; the members of one group were similar at the plasmid level but not at the organism level, and the members of the other group were similar at the organism level. Since the members of the latter group are ecologically successful and have degradative genes unlike tfd genes, they deserve more attention. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60: 1116-1120.	The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was applied to soils in microcosms, and degradation was monitored after each of five repeated additions. Total DNAs were isolated from soil bacterial communities after each 2,4-D treatment. The DNA samples were analyzed on slot blots and Southern blots by using a tfdA gene probe subcloned from plasmid pJP4 and a Spa probe derived from a different 2,4-D-degrading isolate, a Sphingomonas paucimobilis strain. 2,4-D applied to soil was quickly degraded by indigenous microbial populations. As determined by slot blot analyses of DNA from a Michigan soil, the increase in hybridization signal in response to 2,4-D treatments was greater with the Spa probe than with the tfdA probe. In contrast, the DNA from a Saskatchewan soil exhibited an increase in hybridization signal with the tfdA probe. This indicated that a population with 2,4-D-degradative gene sequence; different from the tfdA gene sequence was dominant in the Michigan site, but not in the Saskatchewan site. A Southern blot analysis of DNA from Michigan soil showed that the dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was S. paucimobilis 1443. A less dominant 2,4-D-degrading population was detected with the tfdA probe; further analysis revealed that this population was a Pseudomonas pickettii 712. These gene probe analyses revealed that an important population carrying out 2,4-D degradation was not detected when the canonical tfdA gene probe was used. After a series of new strains were isolated, we identified a probe to detect and identify the dominant members of this new group. 	1	\N

Competition among indigenous and inoculated 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading bacteria was studied in a native Kansas prairie soil following 2,4-D additions. The soil was inoculated with four different 2,5-D-degrading strains at densities of 10(3) cells per g of soil; the organisms used were Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1(pJP4) and three Michigan soil isolates, strain 745, Sphingomonas paucimobilis 1443, and Pseudomonas pickettii 712. Following 2,4-D additions, total soil DNA was extracted and analyzed on Southern blots by using a tfdA gene probe which detected three of the strains and another probe that detected the fourth strain, S. paucimobilis 1443, which belongs to a different class of 2,4-D degraders. P. cepacia DBO1 (pJP4), a constructed strain, outcompeted the other added strains and the indigenous 2,4-D-degrading populations. The S. paucimobilis population was the secondary dominant population, and strain 745 and P. pickettii were not detected. Relative fitness coefficients determined in axenic broth cultures predicted the outcome of competition in soil for some but not all strains. Lag time was shown to be a principal determinant of competitiveness among the strains, but the lag times were significantly reduced in mixed broth cultures, which changed the competitive outcome. Plasmids containing the genes for the 2,4-D pathway were important determinants of competitiveness since plasmid pKA4 in P. cepacia DBO1 resulted in the slower growth characteristic of its original host, P. pickettii, rather than the rapid growth observed when this strain harbors pJP4. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 59: 1581-1587.	The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)-degrading microbial populations selected by 2,4-D amendments to soil were analyzed by DNA probes during a 4-yr held study. Two were control subplots not treated with 2,4-D, and the other six were treated with 2,4-D in replicates at three different concentrations. Total soil bacterial DNA was regularly extracted from each subplot soil and analyzed on slot and Southern blots using the gene probes tfdA and Spa that detect two different 2,4-D-degrading populations. Slot blot analyses revealed that the hybridization signal of the probes to total soil bacterial DNA substantially increased with time and continued 2,4-D application, indicating a shift from a more diverse 2,4-D-degrading microflora to populations that shared greater homology to the two probes. More hybridization signal was obtained with the Spa probe, suggesting that microorganisms with this gene sequence were more dominant than degraders with tfdA-like genes. The Southern blot band patterns indicated that the dominant Spa-hybridizing strain was Sphingomonas paucimobilis strain 1443 and the dominant tfdA hybridizing strain was Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) pickettii strain 712, similar to the results of a previous laboratory microcosm study. At the highest 2,4-D application rate (100 mg kg(-1)), Southern blots probed by 16S rRNA genes showed a limited number of bands, suggesting that the total soil microbial community had been shifted to one or two dominant strains, presumably 2,4-D degraders. 	1	\N

Remote Sensing 36: 1396-1411. 	A study was conducted to assess the potential of combined imagery from the existing European and Japanese orbital synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, ERS-1 (C-band, VV-polarization) and JERS-1 (L-band, HH-polarization), for regional-to-global-scale vegetation classification. For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites mere generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2-D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization. 	1	\N

Using X-ray microprobes for environment research.  Proceedings of the International Society for Optical Engineering 3449: 45-54.	Understanding the fate of environmental contaminants is of fundamental importance in the development and evaluation of effective remediation strategies. Among the factors influencing the transport of these contaminants are the chemical speciation of the sample and the chemical and physical attributes of the surrounding medium. Characterization of the spatial distribution and chemical speciation at micron and submicron resolution is essential for studying the microscopic physical, geological, chemical, and biological interfaces that play a crucial role in determining contaminant fate and mobility. Hard x-ray spectroscopy and imaging are powerful techniques for the element-specific investigation of complex environmental samples at the needed micron and submicron resolution. An important advantage of these techniques result from the large penetration depth of hard x-rays in water. This minimizes the requirements for sample preparation and allows the detailed study of hydrated samples. This paper discuses some current problems in environmental science that can be addressed by using synchrotron- based x-ray imaging and spectroscopy. These concepts are illustrated by the results of recent x-ray microscopy studies at the Advanced Photon Source.	1	\N

Although natural selection appears to favor the elimination of gene redundancy in prokaryotes, multiple copies of each rRNA-encoding gene are common on bacterial chromosomes. Despite this conspicuous deviation from single-copy genes, no phenotype has been consistently associated with rRNA gene copy number. We found that the number of rRNA genes correlates with the rate at which phylogenetically diverse bacteria respond to resource availability, Soil bacteria that formed colonies rapidly upon exposure to a nutritionally complex medium contained an average of 5.5 copies of the small subunit rRNA gene, whereas bacteria that responded slowly contained an average of 1.4 copies. In soil microcosms pulsed with the herbicide 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D), indigenous populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria with multiple rRNA genes ((x) over bar = 5.4) became dominant, whereas populations with fewer rRNA genes ((x) over bar = 2.7) were favored in unamended controls. These findings demonstrate phenotypic effects associated with rRNA gene copy number that are indicative of ecological strategies influencing the structure of natural microbial communities. 	1	\N

Interannual variability in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was assessed with Long-term (mean = 12 years) data from 11 Long Term Ecological Research sites across North America. The greatest interannual variability in ANPP occurred in grasslands and old fields, with forests the Least variable, At a continental scale, ANPP was strongly correlated with annual precipitation. However, interannual variability in ANPP was not related to variability in precipitation. Instead, maximum variability in ANPP occurred in biomes where high potential growth rates of herbaceous vegetation were combined with moderate variability in precipitation. In the most dynamic biomes, ANPP responded more strongly to wet than to dry years. Recognition of the fourfold range in ANPP dynamics across biomes and of the factors that constrain this variability is critical for detecting the biotic impacts of global change phenomena. 	1	\N

We examined the effects of fertilization and gypsy moth defoliation of hybrid poplar (Populus X canadensis Moench 'Eugenei') on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization, ECM richness, and ECM composition in the summers of 1997 and 1998. The factorial experiment included two levels of defoliation (defoliated and control) and fertilization (100 kg N.ha(-1) and control). Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) populations were manipulated to obtain defoliation in the summer of 1996, 1997, and 1998; fertilization subplots were fertilized with NH4NO3 (100 kg N.ha(-1)) in the spring of these years. There were no significant effects of defoliation on ECM or AM colonization in either year; there was a significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) decline in AM colonization in fertilized plots in 1997 and a significant interaction between defoliation and fertilization effects on ECM colonization in 1997. In the nondefoliated plots, ECM fungal colonization increased, whereas AM colonization decreased because of fertilization. In the defoliated plots, neither ECM nor AM colonization was affected by fertilization. ECM community composition and richness were unchanged by any treatment. The small and transient effects of defoliation and fertilization on poplar AMs and ECMs demonstrate the tolerance of these early-successional trees to defoliation and their ability to rapidly use high levels of available nitrogen. 	1	\N

Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. The effects of defoliation on tree physiology are expected to cascade through the entire forest ecosystem, altering carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes, and subsequently affecting nitrogen cycling and plant-herbivore interactions. If these post-defoliation changes are largely driven by, N deficiency, tree root system responses to defoliation should be central to regulating the long-term effects of defoliation; N fertilization should reverse the effects. We examined these phenomena in a 3-year large-scale replicated manipulative field experiment in a hybrid poplar plantation, where we regulated defoliation by gypsy moths as well as nitrogen availability. To our knowledge, this is the first manipulative field experiment at this scale to examine the effects of severe insect defoliation on whole-tree physiology. Defoliation decreased tree growth and increased the rate of top dieback in the stand. Defoliation led to transient declines in carbon allocation to starch in fine roots, trunk, and twigs in the year of heaviest defoliation. Root production and root mortality were unaffected by the heaviest defoliation, but nitrate and ammonium uptake were strongly depressed. N fertilization increased tree growth, but did not alter defoliation effects on starch accumulation or top dieback. Defoliation and fertilization treatments did not interact. In this system, defoliation effects on tree recovery of leaf nitrogen lost to herbivory were primarily driven by effects on nitrogen uptake, rather than effects on root production or mortality. 	1	\N
106	Kosola, K. R., D. I. Dickmann, and D. Parry. 2002. Carbohydrates in individual poplar fine roots- effects of root age and defoliation. Tree Physiology 22:741-746. 	Late-summer starch accumulation in fine roots of poplars (Populus x canadensis Moench.) defoliated by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) lagged behind that in fine roots of undefoliated trees. If starch concentration declines with age, defoliation-induced changes in root system age structure could be partly responsible for this difference. To test this hypothesis, we measured fine-root starch and soluble sugar concentrations in roots of known age from trees in defoliated and undefoliated plots. There was a significant interaction between the effects of defoliation and root type (white, brown, or dead) on fine root soluble sugar concentration because of the high concentration of soluble sugars in white roots from trees in undefoliated plots. Both root starch and soluble sugar concentrations were variable among individuals of each age class. The population frequency distributions for starch and soluble sugar concentrations were both right-skewed, and fit by exponential functions. These data are most consistent with direct defoliation effects on a labile and dynamic pool of carbohydrates in poplar fine roots, rather than indirect defoliation effects on root system age structure. 	1	\N

We examined the relationship between trunk diameter and diameter relative growth rate (RGR) and fine root condensed tannin concentration in 12 genotypes of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh.) planted in three locations across the north central United States. Across genotypes, trunk diameter, diameter RGR and root condensed tannin concentration were negatively correlated at one location (Wisconsin), but showed no significant correlation at the other locations (Iowa and Michigan). The factors responsible for this difference among sites remain unidentified, but may be related to soil fertility. 	1	\N

Early colonizing annual plants are rapidly suppressed in secondary succession on fertile midwestern old fields, while later colonizing perennials persist. Differences in competitive ability for above- and belowground resources may be partly responsible for differences in species persistence during succession, as both light and nutrient availability may change rapidly. We found that, although both above- and belowground competition suppress growth of colonizing plants, belowground competition was the dominant factor in the suppression of the annual Ambrosin artemisiifolia in 2nd-year-old fields near the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan. Despite an ability to persist in later successional fields, seedling transplants of the perennial Achillea millefolium were also suppressed by above- and belowground competition, with belowground competition having the strongest effect. As in many old fields, nitrogen availability is the primary factor limiting plant productivity. There was no clear difference between the species in ability to compete for N-15 from an enriched patch, although there was an indication of greater precision of foraging by Achillea. Life history differences between these species and consequent differences in the phenology of root growth relative to other old-field plants are likely to play a large role in the persistence of Achillea in successional fields where Ambrosia is suppressed. 	1	\N

Changes in soil C as a result of changes in management are relatively slow, and several years of experimentation are needed before differences in management practices can be detected using traditional statistical procedures such as randomized complete block design (RCBD). Using spatial analyses (SA) that take into account spatial variability between plots has a potential for faster and more efficient detection of soil C differences. We hypothesize that for variables with strong spatial continuity, such as total soil C, accurate spatial variability assessment can be obtained even in relatively small experiments. Thus, SA can significantly improve the statistical efficiency of even these experiments. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by comparing performances of RCBD analysis and SA for simulated small-sized experiments where soil C is the response variable. Total soil C data collected from 11 field sites at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) experiment in Michigan were used as an input for simulated experiments. Performance of SA depended on the strength of spatial correlation in soil C and was found to be related to topographical diversity of the experimental sites. In the sites with more diverse topography and stronger spatial correlation of soil C the SA produced lower standard errors for treatment means than those of the RCBD analysis (8 out of 11 sites). In two sites with the flattest topography and weak spatial correlation, SA did not have advantages over RCBD. 	1	\N

Many agroecosystems are unfavorable environments for natural enemies due to high levels of disturbance. Habitat management, a form of conservation biological control, is an ecologically based approach aimed at favoring natural enemies and enhancing biological control in agricultural systems. The goal of habitat management is to create a suitable ecological infrastructure within the agricultural landscape to provide resources such as food for adult natural enemies, alternative prey or hosts, and shelter from adverse conditions. These resources must be integrated into the landscape in a way that is spatially and temporally favorable to natural enemies and practical for producers to implement. The rapidly expanding literature on habitat management is reviewed with attention to practices for favoring predators and parasitoids, implementation of habitat management, and the contributions of modeling and ecological theory to this developing area of conservation biological control. The potential to integrate the goals of habitat management for natural enemies and nature conservation is discussed. 	1	\N

Annual crop fields typically are simple habitats dominated by a few plant species where pesticides play a major role in managing weed and insect infestations. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential to reduce reliance on pesticides by manipulating plant species and communities to benefit natural enemies of insects and weeds. Such efforts aim to enhance natural enemy impact by providing appropriate food, shelter, and hosts, and efforts typically are accomplished by manipulation of plant species, populations, or communities. Habitat management is generally viewed as an important factor in maintaining stable insect and natural enemy populations in agricultural systems and may have a similar function in increasing weed seed predation. Crop and noncrop habitats provide resources to natural enemies either directly through floral nectar and Pollen, indirectly by increased host or prey availability, or through emergent properties of the habitat such as by moderating the microclimate. These critical resources for natural enemies can be provided in agricultural ecosystems at several scales: within fields, at field margins, or as a component of the larger landscape. Because individual natural enemy species may require quite specific resources at different times and spatial scales, not all attempts to manipulate habitat diversity are equally effective. We review the role of plant resources, including weeds, in supporting natural enemy communities and provide case studies of how varying plant diversity at different spatial scales can influence the effectiveness of biological control in agricultural landscapes. 	1	\N

Plant and Soil 187: 147-155.	The Maricopa cotton and wheat FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments offer propitious opportunity to quantify carbon turnover. The commercial CO2 (delta(13)C approximate to-37 parts per thousand) used to elevate CO2 concentration in field plots provided a strongly C-12-depleted tracer. Soil CO2 and delta(13)C of soil organic carbon (SOC) in CO2-enriched and Control plots were measured between the final cotton FACE project (October 1991) and the end of the second wheat experiment (June 1994). The initial C-13-depletion in SOC of cotton FACE plots (measured by the difference in delta(13)C between FACE and Control plots) persisted at the same level (1.9 parts per thousand) 1.5 years after the experiment ended. A similar depletion was observed in soil CO2 evolved in the same plots, indicating ongoing decomposition of the new SOC. The SOC delta(13)C of wheat plots before and after two growing seasons showed increasing C-13-depletion in FACE relative to Control. Isotopic mass balance was consistent with 5-6% new carbon input from the two wheat crops. This is lower than the 12-13% calculated for FACE cotton and perhaps a consequence of the larger root system of cotton or the 3-year duration of the cotton experiments versus 2 years for the wheat. 	1	\N

Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) plant-growth experiments conducted in Arizona have allowed a spinoff isotope tracer experiment (tank CO2 is C-14- and C-13-depleted) to follow the input of carbon into soil organic matter pools. Accurate assessment of the C-14 and C-13 inputs to soils by this pathway requires detailed knowledge of the isotopic composition of the soils before the experiments. We have examined the variability of delta(13)C in soil organic matter in 8 experimental plots prior to the beginning of the 1995-96 FACE experiments with wheat. delta(13)C variability was higher immediately after harvest of a previous crop in June, but the plots were much more homogeneous five months later immediately before planting. Intervening field management, including disking, plowing and installation of irrigation drip tape likely contributed to mixing the soils. 	1	\N

Carabid beetles are polyphagous predators that can act as biological control agents of insect pests and weeds. While current agricultural practices often create a harsh environment, habitat management such as the establishment of within-field refuges has been proposed to enhance carabid beetle abundance and impact. We examined the joint effects of refuge habitats and insecticide application on carabid activity density(parameter of population density and relative activity) and species composition in a cornfield.  2. Our 2-year study comprised four treatments: (i) -refuge/-insecticide; (ii) +refuge/ -insecticide; (iii) -refuge/+insecticide; (iv) +refuge/+insecticide. Refuge strips consisted of grasses, legumes and perennial flowering plants. '-Refuge' strips were planted with corn and not treated with insecticide. 3. Before planting an insecticide application, carabid activity density in the crop areas was similar across all treatments. Insecticide application immediately reduced carabid activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. 4. Refuge strips had significantly higher activity density of beetles than -refuge strips before planting and during the summer. 5. During summer, as new carabids emerged and insecticide toxicity declined, the presence of refuge strips influenced carabids in the adjacent crop area. Carabid activity density within crop areas previously treated with insecticide was significantly higher when adjacent to refuge strips. Also, carabid communities within insecticide-treated crop areas were affected by the presence or absence of a refuge strip. 6. The presence of refuge strips did not consistently augment carabid numbers in crop areas where insecticide was not applied. One explanation may be that insecticides decreased the quality of crop habitat to carabids by depletion of prey and direct mortality. However, subsequent rebounds in prey density and the absence of competing predators may make these areas relatively more attractive than unperturbed crop habitats to carabid colonization from refuges. 7. This study demonstrates that refuges may buffer the negative consequences of insecticide application on carabids in adjacent fields. Diversifying agro-ecosystems with refuge habitats may be a viable strategy for maintaining carabid populations in disturbed agricultural landscapes to keep pests below outbreak levels. 	1	\N

The interplay of dispersal, disturbance, and local dynamics in spatial mosaics has profound effects on the stability and viability of populations. There are two main reasons to consider spatial models in population dynamics: (1) improved estimation of the parameters by utilizing spatial replications, and (2) ecologically realistic modeling. In this paper, we suggest models that are generalizations of the univariate population dynamics models (for example, Ricker or Gompertz) to space-time situations. We accommodate both spatially correlated environmental perturbations and dispersal. Moreover, we suggest computationally simple parameter estimation procedures based on estimating functions and provide an approach for obtaining approximate confidence intervals. The methodology is illustrated on the spatial time series of gypsy moths in the lower peninsula of Michigan. 	1	\N

Transparent plastic minirhizotron tubes have been used to evaluate spatial and temporal growth activities of plant root systems. Root number was estimated from video recordings of roots intersecting minirhizotron tubes and of washed roots extracted from monoliths of the same soil profiles at the physiological maturity stage of a maize (Zea mays L.) crop Root length was measured by the line intercept (LI) and computer image processing (CIP) methods from the monolith samples.  There was a slight significant correlation (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.005) between the number of roots measured by minirhizotron and root lengths measured by the LI method, however, no correlation was found with the CIP method. Using a single regression line, root number WaS underestimated by the minirhizotron method at depths between 0-7.6 cm. A correlation was found between root length estimated by LI and CIP. The slope of estimated RLD was significant with depth for these two methods. Root length density (RLD) measured by CIP showed a more erratic decline with distance from the plant row and soil surface than the LI method. 	1	\N

Biological Control 2: 159-165. 	Studies were conducted during 1989 and 1990 to describe the habitat use patterns of the seven-spotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus. The study site consisted of seven treatments arranged in forty-two 0.91-ha plots. Maize, soybean, wheat, alfalfa, Populus, and successional habitats were represented. Habitats were sampled weekly (from late May to the end of August) using yellow sticky traps, sweep net samples, and visual observations. C. septempunctata was detected in all habitats during both years. Habitat preference, however, depended upon availability of prey and habitat disturbance. In 1989, wheat supported C. septempunctata populations early and mid-season, while Populus supported more C. septempunctata later in the season. In 1990, alfalfa was dominant early in the season, soybean in the mid-season, and successional and alfalfa late in the season. The results indicate that both cultivated and uncultivated habitats play an important role in supporting populations of C. septempunctata. 	1	\N

The influence of weed seed predation by invertebrates and vertebrates was examined in relation to distance from hedgerows in maize fields of southwestern Michigan. Experiments were conducted in spring and winter and included five common weed species, i.e., velvet-leaf (Abutilon theophrasti), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), common lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum), and yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens). In the spring post-tillage study, treatments excluding invertebrates, vertebrates, invertebrates + vertebrates plus no exclusion controls were established at 5 and 100 m from the hedgerow, Seeds were placed into the field in trays filled with sterilized soil at low densities to avoid creating a 'super stimulus' for seed predators. The trays were placed in the field for 3-4 weeks and then placed in a heated greenhouse and seed loss was estimated from the number of seedlings that emerged. The design of the winter study was similar except that only control and vertebrate exclusion treatments were used and seeds were left in the field from December to mid-April. Significant differences among exclusion treatments were found in spring in terms of seed loss. Seed loss was lowest in the treatments that excluded both vertebrates + invertebrates and highest under no exclusion, There was some evidence of preferential predation by vertebrates upon seeds of A. retroflexus and C. album. In winter, significant seed predation by vertebrates on all species except A. retroflexus were detected. In both seasons, seed predation was highly patchy among and within fields and there was no consistent effect of distance from hedgerow. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. 	1	\N

Canadian Journal of Forest Research 28: 359-367.	The influence of tree density (2 x 3, 1 x 2, and 0.5 x 1 m) and weed control (weedy vs. weed free) on the growth and branching architecture of Populus Xeuramericana cv. Eugenei was examined in an experimental plantation in southwestern Michigan, U.S.A. In the presence of weeds, poplars were shorter (p &lt; 0.0001), had a smaller basal diameter (p &lt; 0.0001), initiated fewer branches (p = 0.0004), and had fewer living branches (p = 0.002), shorter branches (p &lt; 0.0001), and branches that spread outward (p &lt; 0.0001). Increasing tree density decreased poplar height (p &lt; 0.0001), basal diameter (p &lt; 0.0001), branch length (p = 0.0062), and the number of living branches (p &lt; 0.0001). At high densities, branches spread outward at their origin (p = 0.0015) and then curved sharply upward (p = 0.002). At the highest planting density there was no difference in branching in plots with and without weed control. However, poplars in the weedy treatment were smaller than those in the weed-free treatment (p &lt; 0.0001). Our results demonstrate that poplar growth and architecture can be influenced by competitors of very different stature. Weeds, in fact, have a greater effect on growth than conspecifics. As a result, poplars grown in the presence of weeds are stunted relative to poplars grown in the absence of weeds, even at the highest tree density where the competitive effects of poplars reduced weed biomass. 	1	\N

The armyworm (Pseudaletia unipuncta) was used as a model host insect to explore the influence of agricultural landscape structure at two spatial scales on larval parasitoid species richness and rates of larval parasitism in southern Michigan. First, within fields, we compared parasitoid communities in maize fields near, and distant from, a hedgerow edge. Second, we replicated these studies within a complex landscape (agricultural fields of small size embedded in a landscape with abundant hedgerows and woodlots) vs. a simple landscape (agricultural fields of large size embedded in a landscape with few hedgerows and woodlots).  The structural differences between the simple and complex agricultural landscapes were characterized by analysis of aerial photographs and digital land-use data. After landscape analysis, three maize fields from each area were selected for the experimental studies. The complex landscape contained fields that were 75% smaller, had 63% more perimeter of wooded field edge per hectare of field area, and had 81% more field edge in wide hedgerow than fields in the simple landscape. Fields in the simple landscape had 74% and 53% more field edge in herbaceous roadside and crop-to-crop interfaces, respectively, than did fields in the complex landscape. In the six selected maize fields, third and fifth instar P. unipuncta were released individually onto maize plants 5 m and 90 m from a hedgerow edge. Larvae were recovered after 4-5 d and reared in the laboratory to record parasitoid emergence. Parasitoid species diversity was similar in both landscape types (simple landscape: four species; complex landscape: five species). Mean percentage parasitism was significantly higher in the complex landscape than in the simple landscape(13.1% vs. 2.4%) but was not affected by the location within fields (near hedgerows vs. distant from hedgerows) in either landscape type. 	1	\N

Global Change Biology 11: 1712-1719. 	The relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) flux and N availability in agricultural ecosystems is usually assumed to be linear, with the same proportion of nitrogen lost as N2O regardless of input level. We conducted a 3-year, high-resolution N fertilizer response study in southwest Michigan USA to test the hypothesis that N2O fluxes increase mainly in response to N additions that exceed crop N needs. We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0-292 kg N ha(-1)) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N2O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N2O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha(-1), where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to &gt; 50 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)). This threshold N2O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N2O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs. 	1	\N

The development of integrated weed management programs requires a clear understanding of the factors and mechanisms conditioning weed community dynamics in agroecosystems. This study evaluated the effect of different agricultural management Systems on the aboveground and seedbank weed communities in annual row crops at the Long Term Ecological Research project in agricultural ecology at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan, USA. Weed biomass and species composition were sampled for six years over two corn-soybean-wheat sequence cycles in four agricultural management systems: (1) conventional (high external chemical input, moldboard plowed); (2) no-till (high external chemical input, no tillage); (3) low-input (low external chemical input, moldboard plowed), and (4) organic (no external chemical input, moldboard plowed), A greenhouse germination study assessed variation in the abundance and composition of the weed seedbank across the studied systems in the first and sixth year of this study.  Aboveground weed biomass, species density, and diversity were lowest in the conventional system, intermediate in the no-till system, and highest in the low-input and organic systems, but there were significant year-by-system interactions. Monocot and dicot species were equally common in the conventional system, whereas annual grasses, such as Digitaria sanguinalis (large crabgrass) and Panicum dichotomiflorum (fall panicum), dominated the no-till system. Two perennial weed species (Trifolium pratense [red clover] and Elytrigia repens [quackgrass]) and one annual dicot (Chenopodium album [common lambsquarters]) dominated the low-input and organic systems. A multivariate ordination of all four systems revealed close associations between the conventional and no-till systems and between the low-input and organic systems. Separate ordinations of the four management systems revealed a crop effect in the low-input and organic systems, but no differentiation in the conventional and no-till ones. The seedbank study revealed a significant increase in the number of weed seeds and species, mainly of annual grasses such as D. sanguinalis and P. dichotomiflorum, in the conventional and no-till systems over the six years of study. During the same period, the number of weed seeds declined in low-input and organic systems. Three annual dicots (Stellaria media [common chickweed], Veronica peregrina [purslane speedwell], and C. album) dominated the seedbank of the low-input and organic systems. Weed aboveground and seedbank community composition were more constant over time in the low-input and organic systems than in the conventional and no-till systems over the study period. These results demonstrate that agricultural management systems can have both immediate and long-term effects on weed species density, abundance, and diversity. The differences observed among management systems in weed biomass, species composition, diversity, and community constancy indicate challenges that exist for the development of ecologically based weed management systems in row crop agriculture. 	1	\N

What is the observed relationship between species richness and productivity? Ecology 82: 2381-2396. 	Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest, this relationship remains controversial. Here, we, present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the relationship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?).  A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richness-productivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous.(i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richness-productivity relationship). Looking more closely at the patterns of productivity-diversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped relationships occurred most frequently (41-45% of all studies). A positive relationship between productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies Within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivity-diversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were especially common (65%) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems. 	1	\N

Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems 7: 67-76. 	When appraising the impact of food and fiber production systems on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the 'greenhouse' effect, the entire suite of biogenic greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) - needs to be considered. Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system. Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40-44% of the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16-33% of GWP in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) y(-1). Carbon accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for &gt; 10 years while the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion to NT. 	1	\N

Stream denitrification and total nitrate uptake rates measured using a field 15N tracer addition approach. Limnology and Oceanography 49: 809-820.	We measured denitrification and total nitrate uptake rates in a small stream (East Fork of Walker Branch in eastern Tennessee) using a new field N-15 tracer addition and modeling approach that quantifies these rates for entire stream reaches. The field experiment consisted of an 8-h addition of 99 atom% (KNO3)-N-15 and a conservative solute tracer. Two 15N tracer addition experiments were performed on consecutive days, the first under ambient NO concentrations (23 mug N L-1) and the second with a NO3- addition of approximately 500 mug N L-1. We fit first-order NO3- uptake and two-box denitrification models to the longitudinal measurements of tracer N-15 in dissolved NO3-, N-2, and N2O in stream water to determine rates. Total NO; uptake rates were 0.028 m(-1) (0.32 mug N m(-2) s(-1)) and 0.01 m(-1) (1.6 mug N m(-2) s(-1)) under ambient NO3- and with NO3- addition, respectively. Denitrification rates were 0.0046 m(-1) (uncertainty range of 0.002 to 0.008 m(-1)) and 9 x 10(-5) m(-1) (uncertainty range of 3 x 10(-5) to 21 x 10(-5) m(-1)) under ambient NO3- and with NO3- addition, respectively. Denitrification resulted almost exclusively in N-2 production (&gt;99%) and comprised about 16% (+/-10%) of total NO3- uptake rate under ambient NO3- concentrations and about 1% (+/-1%) of total NO3- uptake rate with NO3- addition. Denitrification rate expressed on a mass flux basis was about 12 mumol m(-2) h(-1) under ambient NO3- concentrations, a value within the range reported for other streams with low NO3- concentrations. 	1	\N

Environmental Entomology 33: 35-44. 	We used two types of laboratory apparatus to test whether rotation-resistant and wild-type Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) responded differently to corn phenology. Beetles from Nebraska where injury to rotated corn has not been reported were defined as wild type, and beetles from Illinois where injury to rotated corn is common represented &quot;rotation-resistant&quot; populations. A two-chamber emigration arena assayed propensity of both populations to leave corn during and after anthesis. A side-arm olfactometer tested whether the relative attraction of beetles to soybean versus corn was influenced by corn phenology. Beetle origin did not influence departure from corn of varying phenology; both emigrated significantly less from young (shedding pollen) than old (no pollen) corn. Significantly more beetles entered olfactometer chambers with soybean than empty control chambers, but there was no difference in response between the two populations. Numbers of beetles entering chambers with soybean varied with the addition of young versus old corn. Replacing young with old corn approximately doubled the percentage of beetles not selecting corn. As corn aged, adult visitation of soybean increased significantly. We suggest this mechanism is sufficient to explain injury to rotated corn, when linked to a corn crop planted early and synchronously within a landscape limited to corn and soybean. This explanation based on preexisting behavioral plasticity should be given due consideration along with conceptual models of D. v. virgifera rotation resistance that imply genetic change. 	1	\N

Chemical Geology 146: 219-227.	The concentration and delta(15)N of NO3- in leachate from two undisturbed and unfertilized soil lysimeters, one conventionally tilled and one with no tillage, was determined on a bi-weekly basis from March through November, 1993 to assess the origins and transformations of NO3- leaching from an agricultural soil. Concentrations of NO3- in leachate from the tilled lysimeter were approximately twice those from the non-tilled lysimeter throughout the year and are consistent with observations that tilling favors the mineralization process in soils. Although no difference in delta(15)N between lysimeters was evident, NO3- from both lysimeters exhibited considerable isotopic variability, ranging from -3.9 parts per thousand in March to a late summer maximum of 9.6 parts per thousand. Low delta(15)N values in the spring and fall were indicative of NO3- derived from soil organic matter and affected by fractionation during mineralization. High values in late summer indicated NO3- originating from soils that had been influenced to a small extent by fractionation during denitrification. Weighted mean delta(15)N values for NO3- from the conventionally tilled and non-tilled lysimeters were 1.7 and 3.2 parts per thousand, respectively, and are depleted in N-15 by greater than 4 parts per thousand relative to soil organic matter. These delta(15)N values would normally be indicative of NO3- derived from fertilizers, however, in this study they reflect an origin from soil organic matter and are depleted in N-15 in response to fractionation during mineralization. The wide range of delta(15)N values in this study illustrates that sampling of NO3- in soil leachate at one point in time is clearly not sufficient to assess origins or identify the predominant microbial processes occurring in soils. Our results indicate that NO3- in soil leachate is subject to considerable isotopic variation and that delta(15)N may provide more information on the predominance of microbial processes in soils than on origins.

Ecological Applications 12: 1027-1043. 	The natural removal of NO3 by denitrification within riparian zones of streams and rivers is an area of considerable interest owing to its potential to minimize the impacts of excess anthropogenic loadings. In this study we utilize natural variations in stable N isotopic compositions of NO3- and NH4+ within a transect of shallow wells extending 4 m inland from Smith Creek, a southwestern Michigan stream, to provide insight into microbial processes and the extent of NO3- removal within a soil-stream interface. Within this region three water masses with unique biogeochemical characteristics intersect: a shallow flow rich in NH4 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a deep groundwater mass rich in NO3- but depleted in DOC, and stream water low in NO3, NH4+, and DOC. N isotope values for NO, within the well transect were highly variable (-7.7-34.1parts per thousand) and reflected intense microbial activity within this narrow region. Isotopic variation was primarily controlled by upwelling of deep groundwater near the stream and partial loss of NO, via denitrification that was dependent upon a supply of DOC from shallow groundwater.  Quantitative estimates of the fraction of NO3 removed due to denitrification within the soil-stream interface were obtained from N isotope data using a modified Rayleigh equation. Conservative estimates of NO3- removal range from 0% to 86%. In conjunction with measurements of hydrological flows within the sampling wells we provide a novel estimate of NO3- removal based only on natural abundance isotope measurements. NO3- removal was found to vary from undetectable levels to 123 mmol.L-1.m(-2).d(-1) for the narrow region of the soil-stream interface in which deep and shallow groundwater intersect. 	1	\N

Quantifying pathways of energy transfer between plants, pests, and beneficial insects is a necessary step toward maintaining pest stable agroecosystems in the absence of chemical subsidies. A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment '13C and '15N values of H. variegata (-12.0&permil; and 6.3&permil;, respectively) differed by -0.2&permil; and 2.9&permil; from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9&permil; and 8.8&permil; for '13C and '15N values, respectively). Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these beneficial organisms within agroecosystems. 	1	\N

Greater knowledge of intraaggregate porosity modifications by tillage conveys new information for identifying additional hydrologic, ion retention, and aggregate stability responses to specific management practices. Macroaggregates, 2 to 4, 4 to 6.3, and 6.3 to 9.5 mm across, were separated into multiple concentric layers and their porosities were determined. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of multiple aggregate fractions from two soil types subjected to conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and native forest (NF) soils were measured individually to identify the effects of tillage on aggregate structure, porosity, and K-s. Intraaggregate porosities were the highest in NF aggregates. Greater porosities were identified in exterior layers of soil aggregates from all treatments. Lowest intraaggregate porosities were observed in the central regions of CT aggregates. Soil aggregates, 6.3 to 9.5 mm across, had the greatest total porosities, averaging 37.5% for both soil types. Long-term CT reduced intraaggregate porosities and K, within macroaggregates, of the same size fraction, from both the Hoytville silty clay loam and Wooster silt loam soil types. Values for K-s of NF aggregates, 5.0 X 10(-5) cm s(-1), were reduced 50-fold by long-term CT treatments of the Hoytville series. The K-s values through Wooster aggregates from NF, 16.0 X 10(-5) cm s(-1), were reduced 80-fold by long-term CT treatments. The K-s values through NF and NT aggregates were positively correlated with their intraaggregate porosities (R-2 = 0.84 for NF and R-2 = 0.45 for NT at P &lt; 0.005). Additional studies are needed to identify rates at which pore geometries within macroaggregates are degraded by CT or improved by NT. 	1	\N

The stability of soil aggregate structures is very important for controlling aggregate dynamics and associated biogeochemical soil processes that respond to management and other physical disturbances. We examined the mechanical strengths of concentric soil layers from the surfaces to the centers of individual soil macroaggregates and compared them with polar tensile strengths (T-s), total soil C contents, soil texture, and bulk density of aggregates. Aggregates were sampled at depths of 0 to 5 cm from conventionally tilled (CT), no tilled (NT), and native forest (NF) ecosystems of a Wooster (fine-loamy, mesic Typic Fragindalf) and a Hoytville (fine, illitic, mesic Mollic Epiaqualf) soils Erosive strength (E-s) of aggregates was defined as the surrogate for erosive forces required to remove 1 g of soil during 1 min from the Surface of a soil aggregate rotating along the abrasive wall of a soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chamber. Total E-s values of macroaggregates were consistent with T-s of whole aggregates and were controlled by aggregate size and treatment. The E-s increased with decreasing aggregate size and from the exterior to the interior regions of aggregates. Measured changes in soil C content, texture, and bulk density across the different regions within aggregates did not completely explain the spatial distributions of E-s among concentric layers within macroaggregates. Higher contents of C and clay contributed to the greater strengths of the Hoytville soil aggregates, regardless of bulk density. On the other hand, E-s of soil aggregates from coarser-textured Wooster soils were correlated primarily with bulk density and appeared to be independent of C content. 	1	\N

Applied Soil Ecology 11:53-65. 	Field CO2 production was related to soil carbon pools and fluxes determined by laboratory incubation of soils from agroecosystems designed to test the possibility of substituting biological for chemical inputs. Treatments included: conventional and organic-based row crops, woody and herbaceous perennial crops and historically tilled and never tilled successional fields. The CO2 efflux in corn and soybeans was affected by crop residues from previous years and growing season temperatures but not soil moisture. Overwinter cover crops and perennials such as alfalfa and poplar, resulted in fairly uniform fluxes of approximately 20 kg CO2-C ha(-1) day(-1) throughout the non-frozen period. Highest fluxes occurred in alfalfa, historically tilled successional and never tilled, grassland successional treatments, although, highest aboveground productivity occurred in the corn and poplar. Summed, field CO2 fluxes were similar to residue-C inputs. Measurement of CO2 mineralized in extended incubations in the laboratory made it possible to use soil enzyme activity to determine the size and dynamics of soil C pools. The residue of acid hydrolysis defined the size of the resistant pool C-r. Carbon dating determined its mean residence time (MRT). Curve analyses of CO2 evolution plotted on a per unit time basis gave the active (C-a) and slow (C-s) pool sizes and decomposition rate constants k(a) and k(s). Temperature correction factors provided field MRTs. The active pool of this coarse textured soil represents 2% of the soil C with a MRT of 30-66 days. The slow pool represents 40-45% of the SOC with field MRTs of 9-13 years. The poplar soil has the greatest MRT for both the active and slow pools. The system approach to land use sustainability (SALUS) model, which predicts CO2 evolution from decomposition in the field as part of a plant growth - soil process model, was tested using the decomposition parameters determined by incubation and C-14 dating. The model satisfactorily predicted the intra and inter year differences in field CO2 but over predicted fluxes from residues in the fall. It does not yet adequately consider a lag period during which the residues lose their hydrophobicity, are comminuted and colonized. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. 	1	\N

Information on the mean residence time (MRT) of soil organic carbon (SOC) on different soil types and management regimes is required for pedo-geological, agronomic, ecological and global change interpretations. This is best determined by carbon dating the total soil together with acid hydrolysis and carbon dating of the non-hydrolyzable residue (NHC). Midwestern US soils in a transect from Lamberton. MN to Kutztown. PA were found to contain from 33% to 65% of their SOC in the non-hydrolyzable fraction. Soils on lacustrine deposits had the most NHC; glacial till and shale soils, the least. The MRTs of the SOC of surface horizons of soil ranged from modem to 1100 years with an average of 560 years. The MRT increased to an average of 1700 years in the 25-50-cm depth increment and 2757 years at 50-100 cm. The NHC was 1340 years greater at the surface and 5584 years at depth. The MRTs of the total SOC were inversely correlated to sand and directly related to clay content. Silt did not have a significant effect on the MRT of total SOC, but was significantly correlated with the MRT of the NHC. A four-parameter model described the relationship between the SOC content and MRT. The complexity of this equation reflected the strong effect of depth, which greatly decreased SOC while increasing the MRT. The MRT of these soils, as determined with carbon dating of the naturally occurring C-14, was compared to that measured with the C-13 signal produced by approximately 30 years of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (C-4) on soils with a known plant history of C-3-C-4 cropping. The equation of C-14 MRT = 176((CMRT)-C-13)(0.54) with an R-2 of 0.70 showed that although short-term C-13 studies correlate well with the total MRT, they reflect the dynamics of the active and slow pools, not the total SOC.

Soil Science Society of America Journal 67: 1620-1628. 	Interpretation of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics depends heavily on analytical methods and management systems studied. Comparison of data from long-term corn (Zea mays)-plot soils in Eastern North America showed mean residence times (MRTs) of SOC determined by C-14 dating were 176 times those measured with C-13 abundance following a 30-yr replacement Of C-3 by C-4 plants on the same soils. However, MRTs of the two methods were related (r(2) = 0.71). Field C-13 MRTs of SOC were also related (R-2 = 0.55 to 0.85) to those measured by (CO2)-C-13 evolution and curve fitting during laboratory incubation. The strong relations, but different MRTs, were interpreted to mean that the three methods sampled different parts of a SOC continuum. The SOC of all parts of this continuum must be affected by the same controls on SOC dynamics for this to occur. Methods for site selection, plant biomass, soil sampling and analysis were tested on agricultural, afforested-agriculture, and native forest sites to determine the controls on SOC dynamics. Soil-C changes after afforestation were -0.07 to 0.55 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) on deciduous sites and -0.85 to 0.58 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under conifers. Soil N changes under afforestation ranged from -0.1 to 0.025 Mg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Ecosystem N accumulation was -0.09 to 0.08 Mg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Soil C and N sequestration but not plant biomass were related to soil Ca, Mg, and K contents. Comparative, independent assays of long-term plots provides information for concept testing and the confidence necessary for decision-makers determining C-cycle policies. 	1	\N

Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture 35: 929-939.	Soils contain a large proportion of the carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere, yet the role of soils as a sink or a source of net atmospheric C flux is uncertain. In agricultural systems, soil C is highly influenced by management practices and there is considerable interest in adapting management systems to promote soil C sequestration, thereby helping to mitigate atmospheric CO2 increases. Long-term field experimental sites represent a unique source of information on soil C dynamics, and networks of such sites provide a key ingredient for making large-scale assessments of soil C change across ranges in climate and soil conditions and management regimes. Currently, there are collaborative efforts to develop such site networks in Australia, Europe, and North America.  A network of long-term experiments in North America was established to provide baseline information on the effects of management (i.e. tillage, crop rotations, fertilisation, organic amendments) on soil organic matter. Historical data on soils, primary productivity, climate, and management were synthesised by scientists from the individual field sites, representing a total of 35 long-term field experiments. An additional cross-site soil sampling campaign was carried out to provide uniform comparisons of soil C and nitrogen (N), both within and across sites. Long-term field experiments are a principle component necessary for regional assessments of soil C dynamics. We describe a general methodology for combining long-term data with process-oriented simulation models and regional-level, spatially resolved databases. Such analyses are needed to assess past and present changes in soil C at regional to global scales and to make projections of the potential impacts of changes in climate, CO2, and landuse patterns on soil C in agroecosystems. 	1	\N

To study the effects of organic matter and fertilizer additions on soil organic-matter (SOM) dynamics, we analyzed results from a 30-yr-old Swedish field experiment, using the CENTURY model. Field treatments on a sandy clay loam included bannual addition (up to 4000 kg C ha-1) of straw, sawdust, and no organic additions, with and without N fertilizer (80 kg N ha-1), and green manure, farmyard manure, and bare fallow. Soil C and N, crop production (small-grain and root crops), N uptake, and mineralization and immobilization of N were modeled and compared with field measurements. Changes in soil C and N, as much as 30% after 30 yr, were generally well represented by the model. Most of the treatment differences in SOM could be explained by the rate of organic-matter input, its lignin content, and C/N ratio, plus the effect of N fertilizer on belowground C inputs. However, there appeared to be additional positive effects of N supply on SOM accumulation that were not fully explained by the model. The quality of organic amendments strongly influenced N uptake and crop productivity, through controls on N mineralization and immobilization. Mean annual N uptake ranged from a low of 3.1 g m-2 in sawdust-amended soil to a high of 9.2 g m-2 in fertilized, straw-amended soil. Simulated N losses accounted for 7 to 20% of total N inputs. Nitrogen-balance estimates by the model were consistent with the observed data for four of the treatments, but treatments with low N availability appeared to have additional, unexplained N inputs. 	1	\N

Microbiol. 60: 2421-2430.	Disturbances typically associated with the study of soil microbial communities, i.e., sieving, storage, and subsequent incubation at elevated temperatures, were investigated with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Treatment effects were quantified by statistical analyses of the mole percentage distribution of the individual fatty acids. Changes in the concentrations of individual fatty acids over a 7-week storage period at 4.5 degrees C were generally not statistically significant. Sieving effects (mesh size, 4 or 2 mm) on CO2 evolution and the PLFA profile were monitored over 3 weeks; the physical disturbance had only minor effects, although some damage to fungal hyphae by the first sieving (&lt;4 mm) was suggested by a decrease in the signature fatty acid 18:2 omega 6c. Temperature effects were investigated by incubating soil for up to 3 weeks at 4.5, 10, or 25 degrees C. Principal component analyses demonstrated a significant shift in the PLFA composition at 25 degrees C over the first 2 weeks, while changes at the other two temperatures were minor. Several of the changes observed at 25 degrees C could be explained with reference to mechanisms of temperature adaptation or as a response to conditions of stress, including a decrease in the degree of unsaturation, an increased production of cyclopropyl fatty acids, and increased ratios of the branched-chain fatty acids iso-15:0 and iso-17:0 over anteiso-15:0 and anteiso-17:0, respectively. A decrease in the total amount of PLFA was also indicated. 	1	\N

A comparative N-15-tracer study of nitrogen dynamics in headwater streams from biomes throughout North America demonstrates that streams exert control over nutrient exports to rivers, Lakes, and estuaries. The most rapid uptake and transformation of inorganic nitrogen occurred in the smallest streams. Ammonium entering these streams was removed from the water within a few tens to hundreds of meters. Nitrate was also removed from stream water but traveled a distance 5 to 10 times as long, on average, as ammonium. Despite low ammonium concentration in stream water, nitrification rates were high, indicating that small streams are potentially important sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide. During seasons of high biological activity, the reaches of headwater streams typically export downstream Less than half of the input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from their watersheds. 	1	\N

Applied Environmental Microbiology 66: 5410-5418. 	The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different agricultural treatments and plant communities on the diversity of ammonia oxidizer populations in soil. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), coupled with specific oligonucleotide probing, was used to analyze 16S rRNA genes of ammonia oxidizers belonging to the beta subgroup of the division Proteobacteria by use of DNA extracted from cultivated, successional, and native deciduous forest soils. Community profiles of the different soil types were compared with nitrification rates and most-probable-number (MPN) counts. Despite significant variation in measured nitrification rates among communities, there were no differences in the DGGE banding profiles of DNAs extracted from these soils. DGGE profiles of DNA extracted from samples of MPN incubations, cultivated at a range of ammonia concentrations, showed the presence of bands not amplified from directly extracted DNA, Nitrosomonas-like bands were seen in the MPN DNA but were not detected in the DNA extracted directly from soils. These bands were detected in some samples taken from MPN incubations carried out with medium containing 1,000 mug of NH4+-N ml(-1), to the exclusion of bands detected in the native DNA, Cell concentrations of ammonia oxidizers determined by MPN counts were between 10- and 100-fold lower than those determined by competitive PCR (cPCR), Although no differences were seen in ammonia oxidizer MPN counts from the different soil treatments, cPCR revealed higher numbers in fertilized soils. The use of a combination of traditional and molecular methods to investigate the activities and compositions of ammonia oxidizers in soil demonstrates differences in fine-scale compositions among treatments that may be associated with changes in population size and function. 	1	\N

Culture-based methods for enumeration, such as most probable number (MPN) methodologies, have proved inefficient due to difficulties in the isolation and cultivation of ammonia oxidising bacteria in the laboratory. Biases are associated with the isolation of bacteria in selective media and organisms cultivated in the laboratory may not be truly representative of those in the environment. In this study, we developed a competitive PCR (cPCR)-based method based on the amplification of 16S rRNA genes specific for the beta-subgroup proteobacterial ammonia oxidising bacteria for enumeration of these organisms. Populations in both agricultural soils and estuarine sediments were quantified by traditional MPN and by cPCR. The numbers of ammonia oxidisers for both sample types were significantly underestimated by conventional MPN and were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by cPCR. Higher numbers of ammonia oxidisers found in fertilised plots ill agricultural soils by the cPCR technique were not observed in MPN estimates. It was necessary to construct a separate standard curve for each sample type as differences in DNA extraction, quantity and purity had a significant bearing on the ease of PCR of both competitor and target DNA.

The dynamics of fine root systems for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) during seasonal harvests are important for plant regrowth, yet they are not well understood. The primary objective of this study was to determine fine root responses to multiple cuttings of an alfalfa crop for a 5-yr period and during an invasion of companion weed plants during the last 2 yr of the study. Root development, distribution, and turnover rates were evaluated by minirhizotron (MR) and microvideo camera methods on a Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs). The development and distribution of alfalfa fine roots were modified more by season and age of the plants than by defoliation. New root development occurred primarily in the spring and immediately following rainfall interruptions of extended dry periods. Spatial accumulations of roots were observed at the interface of the Bt and 2Bt soil horizons, which also accumulated water and nutrients. More roots died with the progression of each season, especially when plants were 3 to 5 yr of age. New root growth decreased and root death rates increased at soil depths from 0 to 1.1 m, during the period between cuttings from July and August 1993 in the aging alfalfa stand, whose active region of root growth exceeded the depths of the MR observation tubes. New alfalfa root growth appeared at progressively greater depths, especially after 3 yr of cropping. Therefore, mature alfalfa root systems should be sampled to soil depths greater than 1 m. Root systems of encroaching weeds appeared to accumulate in the 0- to 0.6-m region of the soil profile.	1	\N

Wireless sensor networks for ecology. BioScience 7: 561-572. 	Field biologists and ecologists are starting to open new avenues of inquiry at greater spatial and temporal resolution, allowing them to &quot;observe the unobservable&quot; through the use of wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks facilitate the collection of diverse types of data (from temperature to imagery and sound) at frequcnt intervals - even multiple times per second - over large areas, allowing ecologists and field biologists to engage in intensive and expansive sampling and to unobtrusively collect new types of data. Moreover, real-time data flows allow researchers to react rapidly to events, thus extending the laboratory to the field. We review some existing uses of wireless sensor networks, identify possible areas of application, and review the underlying technologies in the hope of stimulating additional use of this promising technology to address the grand challenges of environmental science.	1	\N

This study examined a community of stream bivalves (unionids and fingernail clams) in a second-order woodland stream in southern Michigan using both the natural abundance of N-15 and a 6-week whole-stream N-15 enrichment experiment, as part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX). Objectives included addressing what made up the diet of these bivalves and whether suspended algae consumed by bivalves were derived from pelagic phytoplankton imported from an upstream lake or attached algae sloughed from instream surfaces. Within the examination of bivalve diets, we considered whether suspension- and/or deposit-feeding modes were employed and whether bivalves selectively assimilated the algal and microbial portions of bulk material they ingested. All 12 unionid species reached a level of N-15 enrichment greater than the bulk suspended organic matter. Sphaerium striatinum (Sphaeriidae) were enriched to levels greater than all presumed food sources. Suspended algae were derived both from sloughed epilithon and pelagic phytoplankton originating from lentic waters upstream. A mixing model suggested that unionids were consuming 80% deposited and 20% suspended material. Alternatively, these bivalves were preferentially assimilating the highly enriched living component of suspended and/or benthic organic matter rather than assimilating the bulk material. These results advance our understanding of freshwater bivalve-feeding ecology, which is necessary if conservation efforts of these increasingly threatened organisms are to succeed. 	1	\N

Distribution of root systems through soils and recolonization of root channels by successive crops are fundamental, though difficult to study, processes of soil ecology. This article reports a minirhizotron (MR) study of corn and alfalfa root systems throughout the soil profile of Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) monolith lysimeters for a three-year succession of corn, alfalfa and corn. Multiple-date comparisons within and between years were conducted to estimate total root densities in each soil horizon. Root recolonization was assessed by comparing every video frame of paired minirhizotrons, from recordings conducted one growing season apart. Distributions of corn root systems were modified by tillage practices. In 1994, root populations of corn in the Bt(1) horizon peaked 75-90 days after planting (DAP). Numbers of corn poets per m(2) in the Bt(1) horizon were consistently higher for ns-tillage (NT) than for conventional tillage (CT) lysimeters, in 1994 and 1996. Distribution of alfalfa roots within the soil profile was not significantly modified by tillage. However, alfalfa root decomposition rates responded to conventional and no-tillage practices and were specific for each soil horizon. Corn root systems growing in soils previously cropped with alfalfa presented similar patterns of root distribution by horizons as that of the previous alfalfa crop. Successive corn root systems did not display similar distribution patterns throughout the soil profile from one growing season to the next. Proportions of roots of the current crop recolonizing root induced macropores (RIMs) of the previous crop averaged 18% for corn after corn, 22% for alfalfa after corn and 41% for corn after alfalfa, across Bt horizons and tillage treatments. In conclusion, distribution of corn root systems appeared to be modified by tillage practices and root recolonization of RIMs was controlled by the preceding crop.	1	\N

Decomposing alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) shoots and roots generate large amounts of NO3-N available to the next crop but also susceptible to deep leaching. This study was aimed at determining the specific contributions of above- and belowground alfalfa biomass to soil N pools. Dynamics of soil and plant N pools were studied in a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) over a 2-yr period under bare fallow (BF), bare fallow to which alfalfa shoot mulch was applied (BFSM), living alfalfa plants with shoots removed after harvest (A), and living alfalfa with shoot mulch remaining on the soil surface after harvest (ASM). Organic N pools were monitored in alfalfa plant parts, soil-incorporated debris, and soil organic matter to depths of 150 cm. Inorganic N pools were monitored by suction lysimeters, soil extraction, and evaluation of soil denitrification rates. Living alfalfa stands kept soil inorganic N at very low levels, whether shoot mulch was applied or not. Soluble inorganic N concentrations decreased earlier in the fall in the upper horizons of bare fallow soils receiving alfalfa shoot mulch, suggesting enhanced leaching from bare soil under alfalfa mulch, Alfalfa crown and roots contained an average of 115 kg N ha(-1) after 2 yr of treatment, In conclusion, alfalfa shoot mulch contributed little to sustained increases in soil N pools, while crowns and roots contributed larger quantities to the soil N pool. 	1	\N

Journal of Environmental Quality 28:1365-1371.	Little information is available regarding N management of inbred maize (Zea mays L.), which exports less N than hybrid maize. Nitrate contamination of the groundwater has been a concern in St Joseph County in southwest Michigan where &gt;20 000 ha of seed maize are grown on sand and sandy loam soils. Over application of N fertilizer potentially reduces profits of the local growers and poses a threat to the environment. A field experiment was conducted from 1990 to 1994 to estimate N fertilizer requirements of three different inbred varieties for maximizing yields while minimizing ground water pollution. Yield and N content of grain and stover were analyzed at the end of each growing season. Nitrate leaching was monitored throughout the 5 yr of study by collecting and analyzing drainage flows out of five large field lysimeters. Grain yield was the least responsive to N fertilization, compared with stover biomass, and grain and stover N concentrations. Analyses of yield, NO3-N leaching and soil N balance indicated that the appropriate fertilization of the P38 mid-season inbred approximated 108 kg N ha(-1). Nitrate leaching out of unfertilized plots reached a threshold of 12 to 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), during the last 2 gr of treatment. Application of 101 and 202 kg N ha(-1) generated an average annual loss of 26 and 60 kg N ha(-1), respectively, during the last 2 gr of treatment. 	1	\N
149	Rasse, D. P., and A. J. M. Smucker. 1999. Tillage effects on soil nitrogen and plant biomass in a corn-alfalfa rotation. Journal of Environmental Quality 28:873-880.	Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) stands have been reported to either decrease or increase nitrate (NO3) leaching, depending on tillage management. The fate of alfalfa-generated N and its interaction with N fertilization in a subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) crop remains uncertain. Alfalfa contributions to corn yields and soil mineral N pools were studied under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems over a 3-yr corn-alfalfa-corn sequence. The field experiment compared CT vs. NT managements in fertilized and nonfertilized Kalamazoo loam soils (Typic Hapludalf), Four of the nonfertilized plots were equipped with undisturbed monolith lysimeters to monitor NO3 leaching. Living alfalfa stands lost 6 kg N ha(-1) to deep leaching over a l-yr period, which is much less than the 20 kg NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1) lost by nonfertilized corn following corn. Within the first 6 mo following the spray-killing of the stand, alfalfa plant tissue decomposition contributed to soil mineral N pools up to 115 kg N ha(-1). During a dry year, all corn N requirements were met by plant tissue decomposition of alfalfa and soil organic matter mineralization, while applied N fertilizer accumulated in the soil profile and was highly susceptible to spring leaching. Similar quantities of N were lost to deep leaching from CT and NT systems during corn production, as higher drainage rates in NT systems were compensated by lower NO3-N concentration of the leachates. 	1	\N
150	Rasse, D. P., and A. J. M. Smucker. 2000. Alfalfa root and shoot mulching interactions with soil hydraulic properties and aggregation. Soil Science Society of America Journal 64:725-731.	Although alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) stands have been reported to improve soil physical properties, little is known about the specific influences of above- and belowground alfalfa components on soil physical properties. A 2-yr study was conducted to investigate alfalfa roof and shoot mulch modifications of soil physical properties and water movement in the root zone of a Kalamazoo loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) in southwest Michigan, Four treatments were considered: bare fallow (BF), bare fallow with alfalfa shoot mulch (BFSM), alfalfa with shoots removed and roots remaining (AR), and alfalfa with alfalfa shoot mulch (ASM). Volumetric soil water contents were measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR). Development of fine roots was monitored by minirhizotron technology. Alfalfa root systems increased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) by 57%, total and macroporosities by 1.7 and 1.8%, respectively, and water recharge rate of the soil profile by as much as 5.4% per day. These effects of alfalfa roots on soil porosity were mainly attributed to increased amplitudes of wetting and drying cycles and high rates of root turnover in the Ap horizon. K-sat was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r = 0.90, P less than or equal to 0.01). Mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates From bare fallow soils was 20% higher when alfalfa shoot mulch was applied, Our results suggest that aggregate stability was more affected by C sources from shoot mulch and root turnover than by factors specific to root activities such as physical enmeshment of aggregates and increased soil wetting and drying cycles. 	1	\N

Competition between gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and the northern tiger swallowtail, Papilip canadensis: interactions mediated by host plant chemistry, pathogens, and parasitoids. Oecologia 125: 218-228. 	The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and the northern tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, overlap geographically as well as in their host ranges. Adult female swallowtails are incapable of distinguishing between damaged and undamaged leaves, and the opportunities for competition between these two species are numerous. We designed field and laboratory experiments to look for evidence of indirect competition between P. canadensis and L. dispar larvae. Swallowtail caterpillars were reared in the laboratory on leaves from gypsy-moth-defoliated and undefoliated trees to explore host-plant effects. We tested for pathogen-mediated interactions by rearing swallowtail larvae on both sterilized and unsterilized leaves from defoliated and undefoliated sources. In addition, we measured the effects of known gypsy moth pathogens, as well as gypsy moth body fluids, on the growth and survival of swallowtail larvae. Field experiments were designed to detect the presence of parasitoid-mediated competition, as well: we recorded parasitism of swallowtail caterpillars placed in the field either where there were no gypsy moth larvae present, or where we had artificially created dense gypsy moth populations. We found evidence that swallowtails were negatively affected by gypsy moths in several ways: defoliation by gypsy moths depressed swallowtail growth rate and survival, whether leaves were sterilized or not; sterilization significantly reduced the effect of defoliation, and gypsy moth body fluids proved lethal; and swallowtail caterpillars suffered significantly increased rates of parasitism when they were placed in the field near gypsy moth infestations. 	1	\N

Fluctuating asymmetries are small random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry that result from imperfect regulation of development. Recently, fluctuating asymmetry has been suggested as a tool for monitoring levels of ecological stress within and between populations. Unfortunately, such comparisons of fluctuating asymmetry may be confounded by genetic or age differences among environments. In this study we use a genetically controlled field experiment to determine differences in fluctuating asymmetry due solely to different competitive regimes. We determined fluctuating asymmetry in poplar leaf shape for leaves taken from an even-aged clone grown in six different competitive regimes. We show that increases in intra- and interspecific competition increase fluctuating asymmetry in the leaves of this clone. This supports the use of fluctuating asymmetry as a tool for detecting common environmental stresses such as competition. 	1	\N

Glomalin is a soil proteinaceous substance produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the information available concerning this protein has been collected in relation to its role in soil aggregation. In this study, we explored the distribution of glomalin across soil horizons, decomposition of glomalin, and relationship with soil C and N in an agricultural field, a native forest, and an afforested system. Glomalin was present in A, B, and C horizons in decreasing concentrations. Land-use type significantly affected glomalin concentrations (mg cm(-3)), with native forest soils having the highest concentrations of the three land-use types in both A and B horizons. In terms of glomalin stocks (Mg ha(-1)), calculated based on corrected horizon weights, the agricultural area was significantly lower than both afforested and native forest areas. As measured after a 413 day laboratory soil incubation, glomalin was least persistent in the A horizon of the afforested area.. In agricultural soils and native soils, ca. 50% of glomalin was still remaining after this incubation, indicating that some glomalin may be in the slow or recalcitrant soil C fraction. Comparison of glomalin decomposition with CO2-C respired during incubation indicates that glomalin makes a large contribution to active soil organic C pools. Soil C and N were highly correlated with glomalin across all soils and within each land-use type, indicating that glomalin may be under similar controls as soil C. Our results show that glomalin may be useful as an indicator of land-use change effects on deciduous forest soils. 	1	\N

Engineering and modeling applications often require reasonable estimates of the upper and lower limits of plant extractable water. Laboratory measurements of these limits do not always coincide with field observations. Statistical models to estimate soil water retention can be complicated and usually are not based on field measurements. The objective of this work was to develop simple, generic equations to estimate the field-measured limits of the soil water reservoir based on soil survey data such as texture and bulk density. We used linear regression to estimate the gravimetric upper limit from sand and clay content; the volumetric upper limit can be estimated from the gravimetric upper limit and bulk density. We used non-linear regression to estimate the volumetric plant extractable water from sand content. The lower limit cart be estimated as the difference between the upper limit and the plant extractable water. We adjusted the predictions for coarse fragments and organic C and we placed reasonable upper and lower boundaries to our estimates. The equation for the drained upper limit has a RMSE of 0.030 kg kg(-1) and uses two coefficients. The equation for the plant extractable water has a RMSE of 0.030 m(3) m(-3) and uses three coefficients. We tested the simple model with an independent data set. The RMSE of our model was similar or better than that of a more complex statistical model. 	1	\N

Rethinking the vision for environmental research in U.S. agriculture. BioScience 54: 61-65.	Environmental research in agriculture is today largely reactive, focused on problems at small scales and conducted within narrow disciplinary boundaries. This approach has worked to abate a number of environmental problems created by agriculture, but it has not provided effective solutions for many of the most recalcitrant ones. Furthermore, the approach fails to position agriculture to deliver new environmental benefits that the public and policymakers increasingly demand. A new vision is needed for environmental research in agriculture-one that is anticipatory; promotes long-term, systems-level research at multiple scales; better incorporates important interactions between the biophysical and social sciences; and provides for the proper evaluation of deployed solutions. Achieving this vision will require major changes in funding strategies, in institutional reward structures, and in policies that presently inhibit collaborations across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. It is, nevertheless, time to act. 	1	\N

The spatial distributions of selected soil properties in two adjacent sites in southwest Michigan were examined to evaluate the potential effects of chronic disturbance on resource heterogeneity. One site was a cultivated field that had been cleared, plowed, and cropped annually for decades prior to sampling while the other, uncultivated field was cleared of original forest in 1960 after which it was mown annually but never plowed or cropped. We took replicate samples from a 330-point unaligned grid across the sites for soil pH, gravimetric moisture, inorganic phosphorus, total carbon, and net nitrification and nitrogen mineralization potentials. Soils in the cultivated site contained less than half as much carbon as in the uncultivated site, but had higher levels of inorganic phosphorus and moisture, and higher soil pH. Potential net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates did not differ between sites. Geostatistical analysis showed that almost all properties examined were strongly autocorrelated within each site; structural variance as a proportion of sample variance ranged from 30-95% for all properties, and for any given property differed little between sites. The distance over which this dependence was expressed, however, was for all properties but pH substantially less in the uncultivated site (7-26 m) as compared to the tilled site (48-108 m), especially for total C and net nitrification and N mineralization. These results suggest that the spatial pattern and scale of soil variability can differ markedly among edaphically identical sites and that these differences can be related to disturbance history. 	1	\N

Science 289:1922-1925. 	Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. From 1991 to 1999, we measured gas fluxes and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystems. Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the Late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation. These results suggest additional opportunities for Lessening the GWP of agronomic systems. 	1	\N

Ecological Applications 7: 158-170.	The degree to which soil resource availability is linked to patterns of microbial activity and plant productivity within ecosystems has important consequences for our understanding of how ecosystems are structured and for the management of systems for agricultural production. We studied this linkage in a 48-ha site in southwest Michigan, USA, that had been cultivated and planted to row crops for decades. Prior to seeding the site to genetically identical soybean plants (Glycine max) in early spring, we removed soil samples from approximate to 600 locations; plant biomass was harvested from these same locations later in the season. Soil samples were analyzed for physical properties (texture, bulk density), chemical properties (moisture, pH, total C, total N, inorganic N), and biological attributes (microbial biomass, microbial population size, respiration potential, and nitrification and N-mineralization potentials). Plant analyses included biomass and C and N contents. Soil resource variability across this long-cultivated site was remarkably high, as was variability in microbial activity and primary productivity. In almost all cases variability exhibited a strong spatially explicit structure: for most properties and processes &gt;50% of sample variance was spatially dependent at a scare of 5-60 m. Exceptions included microtopography, soil pH, and inorganic P, which were spatially dependent across the entire 1-1200 m range of separation distances examined in this study, and the culturable-bacteria population, which was not spatially autocorrelated at any scale examined. Both topographic relief and soil pH exhibited strongly nested structures, with autocorrelation occurring within two (topography) or more (pH) distinct ranges. Multiple regression analysis showed surprisingly little correlation between biological processes (soybean productivity, soil N turn-over, soil respiration), and static soil properties. The best predictor of soybean biomass at late reproductive stages (r(2) = 0.42) was a combination of nitrate N, bulk density, inorganic P, N-mineralization rates, and pH. Overall, results suggest a remarkable degree of spatial variability for a pedogenically homogeneous site that has been plowed and cropped mostly as a single field for &gt;100 yr. Such variability is likely to be generic to most ecosystems and should be carefully evaluated when making inferences about ecological relationships in these systems and when considering alternative sampling and management strategies. 	1	\N
161	Robertson, G. P., and P. R. Grace. 2004. Greenhouse gas fluxes in tropical and temperate agriculture: The need for a full-cost accounting of global warming potentials. Environment, Development and Sustainability 6:51-63.	Agriculture&rsquo;s contribution to radiative forcing is principally through its historical release of carbon in soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and through its contemporary release of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). The sequestration of soil carbon in soils now depleted in soil organic matter is a well-known strategy for mitigating the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere. Less well-recognized are other mitigation potentials. A full-cost accounting of the effects of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to quantify the relative importance of all mitigation options. Such an analysis shows nitrogen fertilizer, agricultural liming, fuel use, N2O emissions, and CH4 &#64258;uxes to have additional signi&#64257;cant potential for mitigation. By evaluating all sources in terms of their global warming potential it becomes possible to directly evaluate greenhouse policy options for agriculture. A comparison of temperate and tropical systems illustrates some of these options. 	1	\N
162	Robertson, G. P., and S. M. Swinton. 2005. Reconciling agricultural productivity and environmental integrity: A grand challenge for agriculture. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 3: 38-46.	Agriculture meets a major human need and both affects and depends on all other life support systems. Current trends point to continued human population growth and ever higher levels of consumption as the global economy expands. This will stress the capacity of agriculture to meet food needs without further sacrificing the environmental integrity of local landscapes and the global environment. Agriculture's main challenge for the coming decades will be to produce sufficient food and fiber for a growing global population at an acceptable environmental cost. This challenge requires an ecological approach to agriculture that is largely missing from current management and research portfolios. Crop and livestock production systems must be managed as ecosystems, with management decisions fully informed of environmental costs and benefits. Currently, too little is known about important ecological interactions in major agricultural systems and landscapes and about the economic value of the ecosystem services associated with agriculture. To create agricultural landscapes that are managed for multiple services in addition to food and fiber will require integrative research, both ecological and socioeconomic, as well as policy innovation and public education. 	1	\N

Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. These outbreaks are thought to be responsible for substantial cycling of nitrogen (N), and its loss from the system. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations within poplar plots were manipulated over 2 years so that the ecosystem-wide consequences of catastrophic defoliation on N cycling could be examined. The quantities of N in leaf litter-fall, ammonia volatilization and soil N pools were estimated across the two seasons. Defoliated leaf biomass was estimated from experimentally derived approximate digestibility factors and added to the mass of senesced leaf to determine total annual leaf production. Throughout the growing season the defoliation treatment peaked at about 40% in year 1 and 100% in year 2. Rapid regrowth after defoliation meant that only 45% of the annual leaf biomass was consumed in the defoliation treatment in year 2, while control plots suffered about 20% consumption each year. In each year, defoliated plots produced 20% more leaf biomass and N than the controls, a phenomenon attributed to compensatory photosynthesis. No substantial losses of N via ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission or nitrate leaching were observed. Neither was there any sustained or substantial gain in the soils microbial biomass or inorganic N pools. These observations suggest that the defoliated poplars were able to compete with soil microbes and N loss mechanisms for soil N as it became available, thereby ameliorating the effects of defoliation on soil nitrogen cycling. We conclude from this study that the N mineralized from defoliation residues was conserved in this plantation ecosystem. 	1	\N

The design of sustainable N management strategies requires a better understanding of the processes influencing the ability of soils to supply N to a growing crop. Although commonly ignored, the release of C by plant roots may have a tremendous impact on soil organic matter turnover under certain soil conditions. The main objective of this study was to determine if living corn (Zea mays L.) roots would increase the N-supplying capacity of a soil with an enhanced mineralizable N pool. A rotation of corn-corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in combination with cover crops and the application of composted manure were used to increase the mineralizable N pool. The N-supplying capacity of bare soil and soils planted with corn and wheat was calculated, and changes in N and C pool sizes were determined by laboratory incubations. Living corn roots increased the inorganic N-supplying capacity of the conditioned soil by &gt;50%. We suggest that this increase is caused by an increase in net N mineralization. This is supported by the considerable size reduction of the 70-d N pool in the soil planted with corn. No significant increase in the soil N-supplying capacity was observed when wheat was planted, indicating the possibility that this effect may vary dramatically among plant species. The contribution of corn and wheat root rhizodeposition to the active C pool and as energy source to enhance microbial activity and organic matter turnover is discussed. 	1	\N

Integrated agricultural systems: Managing soil carbon and nitrogen for productivity and environmental quality. Agronomy Journal 96: 769-775. 	In this study, we investigated the impact of cropping system management on C and N pools, crop yield, and N leaching in a long-term agronomic experiment in Southwest Michigan. Four management types, conventional (CO), integrated fertilizer (IF), integrated compost (IC), and transitional organic (TO) were applied to two crop sequences, a corn (Zea mays L.)-corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation and continuous corn, which were grown with and without cover crops in the IF, IC, and TO managements. Using compost as a fertility source and reducing the use of herbicides and other chemicals resulted in long-term changes in soil organic matter pools such TO greater than or equal to IC &gt; IF greater than or equal to CO for total C and N and for the labile C and N measured through aerobic incubations at 70 and 150 d. Mineralizable N varied within the rotation, tending to increase after soybean and decrease after corn production in all systems. Corn yield was closely associated with 70-d N mineralization potential, being greatest for first-year corn with cover and least for continuous corn without cover under all management types. Although the TO and IC systems produced the lowest yield for second-year or continuous corn, the combination of soybean and wheat plus red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) always supported high yield for first-year corn. Fall nitrate level and nitrate leaching were higher for commercially fertilized corn than for any other crop or for compost-amended corn. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 65: 1442-1447. 	The development of sustainable N management systems requires a better understanding of the contribution of on-farm resources to the active N pool size and its mineralization. This study explores the effect of substrate diversity on improving N supply through mineralization. A &quot;diverse system&quot;, consisting of a corn (Zea mays L.)-cornsoybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation with cover crops and fertilized with composted manure was compared with a corn monoculture with conventional fertilizers. Nitrogen mineralization was measured in situ and in laboratory incubations as was the ability of each soil to mineralize added compost and red clover (Trifolium pratense) residue in the 6th and 7th yr of rotation. Net mineralized N in the diverse system was 90 and 40% higher than that in the monoculture at 70 and 150 d of laboratory incubations respectively. Comparable response was found in situ where a 70% higher net mineralization was observed in the diverse system at 70 d. The 70 and 150-d mineralizable N pools increased over time, but the ability of soil organisms to break down additional substrate did not change as a result of system diversity. At 150 d of laboratory incubation, a synergistic effect was observed when 5 Mg ha(-1) of compost plus 5 Mg ha (1) of clover was added to either soil. The combination of the two organic materials mineralized more N than the sum of their individual mineralization results. A more diverse cropping system may increase the soil's capacity to supply N to a growing crop while maintaining desirable levels of soil organic matter. This is essential for the overall long-term productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems. 	1	\N

A key issue in ecology is how patterns of species diversity differ as a function of scale. The scaling function is the species-area curve. The form of the species-area curve results from patterns of environmental heterogeneity and species dispersal, and may be system-specific. A central concern is how, for a given set of species, the species-area curve varies with respect to a third variable, such as latitude or productivity. Critical is whether the relationship is scale-invariant (i.e. the species-area curves for different levels of the third variable are parallel), rank-invariant (i.e. the curves are non-parallel, but non-crossing within the scales of interest) or neither, in which case the qualitative relationship is scale-dependent. This recognition is critical for the development and testing of theories explaining patterns of species richness because different theories have mechanistic bases at different scales of action. Scale includes four attributes: sample-unit, grain, focus and extent. Focus is newly defined here. Distinguishing among these attributes is a key step in identifying the probable scale(s) at which ecological processes determine patterns. 	1	\N

Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades. Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed. 	1	\N
171	Scriber, J. M. 2002. Latitudinal and local geographic mosaics in host plant preferences as shaped by thermal units and voltinism. European Journal of Entomology 99: 225-239. 	Laboratory and field tests support the &quot;voltinism-suitability hypothesis&quot; of host selection at various latitudes as well as in local &quot;cold pockets&quot;: The best hosts for rapid development will be selected by herbivorous insects under severe thermal constraints for completion of the generation before winter. Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to &quot;phenological twisting&quot; of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with &quot;thermally constrained&quot; growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection.  Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent &quot;species-diagnostic&quot; trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone. 	1	\N

Non-target impacts of forest defoliator management options: Decision for no spraying may have worse impacts on non-target Lepidoptera that Bacillus thuringiensis insecticides. Journal of Insect Conservation 8: 241-261.	Management programs for major forest defoliators such as gypsy moths or forest tent caterpillars, and crop pests such as the European corn borer have shifted from broad-spectrum insecticides to more environmentally benign microbial pesticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis (foliage sprays and transgenic toxin expression in plant tissues). Phytochemically resistant host plants and natural enemies have been used as alternative pest management strategies (including generalist tachinid &#64258;ies such as Compsilura, viruses, microsporidians, and fungi), but all of these have some non-target impacts, as described from literature review. A sequence of lab and &#64257;eld studies were conducted to determine non-target impacts on native Lepidoptera in North America. The conclusions reached are that a decision not to spray Bt pesticides (i.e. to allow defoliation and natural pest outbreaks to run their course) could be as bad or worse for non-target Lepidoptera as the microbial insecticides would be. The important concept that must be maintained is that all pest management programs have some risk of negative non-target impacts, but it is the magnitude and relative importance that will remain the most critical issue for environmental impacts and pest management. 	1	\N

Using hybrid and backcross larvae of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus to detect induced phytochemical resistance in hybrid poplar trees experimentally defoliated by gypsy moths. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 91:233-236.	Sub-plots of hybrid poplars were experimentally defoliated using 10 million gypsy moth larvae. Half of the defoliated (and undefoliated control) plots were fertilized to see if this would ameliorate the predicted induction of carbon-based phenolic defenses in the regrowth leaves. In order to bioassay the leaves of the four different treatments, we employed a continuum of genotypes (different hybrids and backcrosses of two different species of tiger swallowtail butterflies) with different abilities to detoxify these allelochemicals. Based on our previous studies with phytochemicals from the Salicaceae plant family, Papilio canadensis was likely to consume and process all Populus spp treatments, whereas P. glaucus predicted to either not consume or else quickly die on all Populus treatment leaves. Hybrid and backcross larvae of these two butterfly species are known to have intermediate levels of esterase detoxication enzymes and would therefore be likely to provide a continuum or at least varying degrees of sensitivity in bioassays for even the most subtle induction responses in the regrowth leaves. This presumption was supported in the feeding and growth studies conducted at different times post-defoliation during the 1997 growing season in Michigan. 	1	\N

Ecography 25: 184-192.	The reasons that the northern tiger swallowtail butterfly Papilio canadensis does not move south of the Great Lakes hybrid zone, where it meets P. glaucus, may be largely due to natural temperature-induced stress on diapausing pupae, Temperatures of 36degreesC for only four days killed all P. canadensis (from northern Michigan) and most of the Papilio troilus, a species that lives south of the hybrid zone (sympatrically with P. glaucus). In contrast, interspecific hybrids (P. glaucus mother x P. canadensis father) had significant adult eclosion or pupal survival at both 30degrees and 36degreesC. All surviving hybrid pupae were only females (the heterogametic sex, which are known to express the prolonged diapause due to Haldane effects). The southern species, P. troilus, had almost all (81%) normal (non-deformed) adults eclose at 30degreesC, whereas only 20% of the A canadensis females and ca 30% or the A canadensis males eclosed to produce non-deformed adults. Unlike the case with P. troilus and P. canadensis, no hybrid females eclosed at 30degreesC (only males did). Unlike P. troilus and P. canadensis pupae, hybrid (female) pupae remain viable, some of which have already successfully emerged after the chamber experiments. A follow-up study using P. glaucus, P. canadensis (from Vermont), and their hybrids with more normal lower thermal regimes included (27degrees, 30degrees, 33degrees, and 36degreesC) again showed higher hybrid survival as uneclosed (living) pupae at 36degreesC. In addition, A glaucus and P. canadensis showed high mortality and wing deformity of eclosing adults at 36degreesC, suggesting that geographic source of the P. canadensis may reflect differential tolerances of the extreme 36degreesC temperature. 	1	\N

Great Lakes Entomologist 25: 91-98.	Native hop vine borer (Hydraecia immanis) and introduced potato stem borer (H. micacea) populations in Midwest corn have reached noticeable levels near the Great Lakes plant community ecotone between boreal forests and temperate deciduous forests. The hop vine borer is more specialized in its diet and occurs in corn generally south of the plant community ecotone, whereas the potato stem borer is polyphagous and occurs in corn mostly north of the Great Lakes plant transition zone. We analyzed the genetic composition of each species using cellulose acetate electrophoresis and resolved 19 loci of which 6 exhibited fixed or nearly fixed allelic differences. We expect that this will be useful in determining the degree of hybridization where the two species become sympatric due to expected continued range expansions in Michigan, Wisconsin, and New York State. 	1	\N

Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 115: 247-263. 	North American Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae, these Papilio = Pterourus) have previously been described as having allopatric distributions separated by a narrow hybrid zone running from Minnesota to southern New England, and southward in the Appalachian Mountains (possibly to northern Georgia). Recent patterns of hybridization and introgression suggest a more complex interaction between the two, possibly even resulting in the formation of a new species (Pterourus appalachiensis Pavulaan N Wright, 2002). Recently, extensive northward interspecific introgression of P. glaucus-diagnostic traits has been observed in the hybrid zone. These include wing bands and other color patterns, the ability to feed on tulip tree leaves, and Hk-100 allozymes; all are autosomally encoded. However, there has been little northward introgression of certain other P. glaucus traits (such as facultative diapause and bivoltinism, and Ldh-100 allozymes, both X-linked; and the Y-linked melanic mimicry gene in females). Interspecific recombination of the X-chromosome has evidently occurred, as shown by discordant patterns of X-linked markers. The P. glaucus X-linked Pgd-100 and Pgd-50 alleles have introgressed 200-400 km north of the historical hybrid zone, yet the P. glaucus X-linked Ldh-100 allele has not. The allele frequency shift for both genes is more closely related to the 'thermal landscape' (i.e., accumulated degree-days above a developmental base threshold of 50 degrees F (=10 degrees C)) than to latitude. Delayed post-diapause eclosion of cohorts within the hybrid zone, e.g., the New York/Vermont border area, has produced a natural 'false-second generation' flight (a hybrid swarm of synchronous males and females, where 2300-2700 degrees F degree-days have accumulated each year since 1998) that is reproductively isolated from flights of both parental species. Moreover, the newly described P. appalachiensis exhibits a unique combination of traits. These include obligate diapause, a univoltine habit, and the Ldh-80 or Ldh-40 alleles (as for P. canadensis), the Pgd-100 or Pgd-50 alleles (as for P. glaucus), and a delayed 'false-second generation' reproductive flight period (as observed in the hybrid zone). Since 2001, a rare allele or 'hybrizyme' (Ldh-20) has appeared in this false second generation at high frequencies (40-50%). We hypothesize that strong selection against the facultative diapause (od-)trait (and the linked Ldh-100 allele) in regions with 2800 degrees F degree-days or less, and divergent selection in favor of Pgd-100 (or a closely linked trait) combined with allochronic reproductive isolation, has resulted in recombinational, parapatric, hybrid speciation. There is no evidence at present that host-plant shifts or changes in sex pheromones have driven this process, in contrast to many other speciation events in the Lepidoptera. 	1	\N

Identifying 'functional' pools of soil organic matter and understanding their response to tillage remains elusive. We have studied the effect of tillage on the enriched labile fraction, thought to derive from microbes and having an intermediate turnover time. Four soils, each under three regimes, long-term arable use without tillage (NT), long-term arable under conventional tillage (CT), and native vegetation (NV), were separated into four aggregate size classes. Particle size fractions of macro- (250-2000 mu m) and microaggregates (53-250 mu m) were isolated by sonication and sieving. Subsequently, densiometric and chemical analyses were made on fine-silt-sized (2-20 mu m) particles to isolate and identify the enriched labile fraction. Across soils, the amounts of C and N in the particle size fractions were highly variable and were strongly influenced by mineralogy, specifically by the contents of Fe and Al oxides. This evidence indicates that the fractionation procedure cannot be standardized across soils. In one soil, C associated with fine-silt-sized particles derived from macroaggregates was 567 g C m(-2) under NV, 541 g C m(-2) under NT, and 135 g C m(-2) under CT, whereas C associated with fine-silt-sized particles derived from microaggregates was 552, 1018, 1302 g C m(-2) in NV, NT and CT, respectively. These and other data indicate that carbon associated with fine-silt-sized particles is not significantly affected by tillage. Its location is simply shifted from macroaggregates to microaggregates with increasing tillage intensity. Natural abundance C-13 analyses indicated that the enriched labile fraction was the oldest fraction isolated from both macro- and microaggregates. We conclude that the enriched labile fraction is a 'passive' pool of soil organic matter in the soil and is not derived from microbes nor sensitive to cultivation. 	1	\N

The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53-250 mum sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs. 	1	\N

Soil Biology and Biochemistry 32: 2099-2103. 	Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the I:ate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT.

Tillage generally reduces aggregation and particulate organic matter (POM) content. We hypothesized that reduced C sequestration in conventional tillage (CT) compared with no-tillage (NT) is related to differences in aggregate turnover. Four soils (Haplustoll, Fragiudalf, Hapludalf, and Paleudalf), each with NT, CT, and native vegetation (NV) treatments, were separated into aggregates. Free light fraction (LF) and intraaggregate POM (iPOM) were isolated. At one site we used C-13 natural abundance to differentiate crop- and grassland-derived C. Concentrations of coarse iPOM C (250-2000 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates), expressed on a per unit aggregate weight (g iPOM C kg(-1) aggregate), did not differ between tillage treatments. In contrast, concentrations of fine iPOM C (53-250 mu m iPOM in macroaggregates) were less in CT compared to NT macroaggregates, On a whole soil basis, fine iPOM C was on average 51% less in CT than in NT, and accounted for 21% of the total C difference between NT and CT. The concentration of free LF C was not affected by tillage, but was on average 45% less in the cultivated systems than NV. Proportions of crop-derived C in macroaggregates were similar in NT and CT, but were three times greater in microaggregates from NT than microaggregates from CT. We suggest that a faster turnover rate of macroaggregates in CT compared with NT leads to a slower rate of microaggregate formation within macroaggregates and less stabilization of new SOM in free microaggregates under CT. 	1	\N

Measuring and understanding carbon storage in afforested soils by physical fractionation. Soil Science Society of America Journal 66: 1981-1987. 	Forested ecosystems have been identified as potential C sinks. However, the accuracy of measurement and understanding of the underlying mechanisms for soil organic C (SOC) storage in forested ecosystems needs to be improved. The objective of this study was to use aggregate and soil organic matter (SOM) fractionation techniques to identify SOC pools that preferentially stabilize SOC in the long term and elucidate SOC sequestration mechanisms in forested soils. At two sites (Wildlife area, Ohio and Kemptville, Ontario) representing two different soils (Hapludalf and Hapludoll), we sampled soils under agriculture, afforestation, and forest and separated them into aggregates. Different size classes of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) fractions were isolated by density flotation, dispersion, and sieving. At both sites, aggregation and whole SOC content were greater in the forested than in the agricultural ecosystems. The greater aggregation in forested ecosystems resulted in greater iPOM C concentrations, especially the iPOM C fractions associated with microaggregates (53-250 mum) and microaggregates occluded within macroaggregates (mM) (250-2000 mum). The sum of C in these fractions (microaggregate protected C) was 468 +/- 29, 696 +/- 171, 673 +/- 70 g C m(-2) in the agricultural, afforested, and forested soils at Kemptville, respectively. The difference in the microaggregate protected C between the agricultural and the afforested soils accounted; on average, for 20% of the difference in whole SOC stocks between the soils. We conclude, SOC is stabilized for a relatively longer term within microaggregates formed in afforested and forest systems. Therefore, we suggest a new fractionation scheme to isolate this microaggregate associated SOC for assessing the impact of land use, land management, and climate change on C storage. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 64:1042-1049.	Soil aggregate distribution and stability measurements have been proposed as soil quality indicators. However, pretreatment of soil, antecedent water content and differences in sand size distribution among soils can confound interpretation of these measurements. We propose a normalized stability index (NSI) which (i) compares aggregate distribution after slaking and rewetting to characterize whole soil stability and eliminate confounding effects of pretreatment and antecedent water content, (ii) corrects for the confounding effect of differences in sand size distribution among soils, aggregate size classes and pretreatments, and (iii) normalizes the level of disruption imposed by slaking by using a maximum level of disruption. The NSI was tested on three soils dominated by a 2:1 clay mineralogy and one soil characterized by a mixed (2:1 and 1:1) clay mineralogy. Each site had native vegetation (NV), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT) treatments. In soils dominated by 2:1 clays, NSI decreased with increasing cultivation intensity (NV &gt; NT &gt; CT). However, NSI was higher in the soil with mixed clays compared to the other soils and was not different along the cultivation gradient. These observations are hypothesized to be related to the presence of Fe- and Al-oxides and kaolinite. In conclusion, NSI appears to be a good indicator for soil structural quality since it is sensitive to changes in agricultural practices and it minimizes confounding effects. A decrease of SOM levels results in a smaller decrease of soil stability in soils dominated by oxides and 1:1 minerals compared to soils dominated by 2:1 minerals. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 64:681-689.	Cultivation reduces soil C content and changes the distribution and stability of soil aggregates. We investigated the effect of cultivation intensity on aggregate distribution and aggregate C in three soils dominated by 2:1 clay mineralogy and one soil characterized by a mixed (2:1 and 1:1) mineralogy. Each site had native vegetation (NV), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT) treatments. Slaked (i.e., sir-dried and fast-rewetted) and capillary rewetted soils were separated into four aggregate-size classes (&lt;53, 53-250, 250-2000, and &gt;2000 pm) by wet sieving. In rewetted soils, the proportion of macroaggregates accounted for 85% of the dry soil weight and was similar across management treatments. In contrast, aggregate distribution from slaked soils increasingly shifted toward more mirroaggregates and fewer macroaggregates with increasing cultivation intensity. In soils dominated by 2:1 clay mineralogy, the C content of macroaggregates was 1.65 times greater compared to microaggregates. These observations support an aggregate hierarchy in which microaggregates are bound together into macroaggregates by organic binding agents in 2:1 clay-dominated soils. In the soil with mixed mineralogy, aggregate C did not increase with increasing aggregate size. At all sites, rewetted macro- and microaggregate C and slaked microaggregate C differed in the order NV &gt; NT &gt; CT. In contrast, slaked macroaggregate C concentration was similar across management treatments, except in the soil with mixed clay mineralogy, We conclude that increasing cultivation intensity leads to a loss of C-rich macroaggregates and an increase of C-depleted microaggregates in soils that express aggregate hierarchy. 	1	\N

A field study was conducted to determine if earthworm activity would affect the abundance and composition of weed seed banks in annual row-crops. The abundance of weed seeds in surface-deposited earthworm casts was determined in continuous monocultures and rotations that included corn, soybean, and winter wheat, with or without cover crop. Casts were collected weekly over the growing season and the weed seed content determined by direct germination in a heated greenhouse. Weed seed composition in surface casts was compared to that in the seed bank (0-5 cm) and soil surface by the same method. Earthworm cast production varied temporally and among crops and was higher in winter wheat compared to corn or soybean. The effect of crop rotation on cast production was significant only in soybean, with the highest production in monocultures compared to three-crop rotations. Weed seed densities were significantly higher in casts collected from winter wheat than corn or soybean. Comparisons of the composition and relative abundance of seeds in earthworm casts with the surface soil layer and seed batik suggest that earthworms contribute to redistribution of weed seeds over the growing season.

The effects of crop rotation and management system on annual variability in weed communities and crop yields were assessed in a 4-yr study in Michigan. Variability of the weed community and corn yields were assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and a multivariate dissimilarity index (Bray-Curtis) that accounted for changes in both weed species abundance and composition. The treatments included two rotations: continuous corn and a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation, and two management systems: conventional (CONV) and organic-based (ORG). Weed biomass was significantly higher in the ORG system; however, there was no effect of crop rotation on weed biomass or number of weed species in a treatment (species richness). Annual variability in weed community composition and structure was affected by both crop rotation and management system and was highest in the ORG rotation. In contrast to the weed community, variability in corn yield was highest in the least-diverse cropping system (CONV monoculture), despite that system having a more constant weed community. Corn yield in the ORG rotation was not significantly different from that in the CONV monoculture. Results of this study suggest that management aimed at increasing cropping system diversity may have additional effects on weed communities and crop yields beyond those commonly reported, and these may have important implications for the development of more efficient and sustainable weed and crop management practices. 	1	\N

Water absorption is influenced by the geometric distribution of viable roots and the availability of water at root surfaces. Utilization of additional plant energy for the extensive and localized development of root systems is a high risk investment of carbon by the plant, especially during short-term water deficits. Nonuniform root distribution, resulting from root growth within networks of continuous soil macropores, reduces the efficiency of water absorption by minimizing contact between roots and increasing the geometric mean pathway of water from the bulk soil to the root. Root clustering in these soil niches causes greater intraspecific competition for the limited water, especially as soil water deficits develop more deeply within the soil profile. Current methods for quantifying and predicting plant root and soil water relationships are reviewed, and some research and modeling imperatives are presented. 	1	\N

The classification of agricultural tillage systems has proven challenging in the past using traditional classification methods due to the similarity of spectral reflectance signatures of soils and senescent crop residues. In this study, five classification methods were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) cropping methods: minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance, Maximum Likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and the cosine of the angle concept (CAC). A Landsat ETM+ image acquired over southern Michigan and northern Indiana was used to test these classification methods. Each classification method was validated with 293 ground truth sampling locations collected commensurate with the satellite overpass. Classification accuracy was then assessed using error matrix analysis, Kappa statistics, and tests for statistical significance. The results indicate that of the classification routines examined, the two spectral angle methods were superior to the others. The cosine of the angle concept algorithm outperformed all the other classification routines for tillage practice identification and mapping, yielding an overall accuracy of 97.2% (Kappa = 0.959).

Cellular fatty acid composition of 100 different filamentous fungi, including oomycetes, zygomycetes, ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and sterile mycelia, was analyzed to determine if they can be differentiated from one another on this basis and how minor variations in culture temperature and age affect this characteristic, Many fungi were found to possess the same fatty acids but produced different relative concentrations of each, Some fungi differed in both the fatty acids produced and in the relative concentrations of others, Multivariate discriminant analysis demonstrated that all of the species included in this study had significantly different (P &lt; 0.001) fatty acid profiles, Each of the three phyla from which representative species were analyzed and the sterile forms had distinctive fatty acid profiles, Significant differences in fatty acid composition were also found at the intraspecific level, Both culture temperature and age affected fatty acid composition in the fungi examined, but when these factors were held constant, variance in fatty acid composition was not a problem and fungal fatty acid profiles could be differentiated statistically. 	1	\N

We studied the relationship between amounts of fungi and ergosterol in soil to further evaluate the use of ergosterol as an indicator of soil fungal biomass. Soils from seven sites in central Iowa were analyzed for soil ergosterol content, total fungal hyphal length (living and non-living, using calcofluor as stain), and living fungal hyphal length (using fluorescein diacetate as stain) to: 1) determine how soil ergosterol concentration correlates with total fungal hyphal length and living fungal hyphal length; and 2) determine an approximate value for ergosterol concentration in living fungal biomass present in soil. Correlation significance tests and analysis of variance indicated highly significant positive correlation between soil ergosterol content and both measures of hyphal length, but regression analysis demonstrated only a moderate degree of linear correlation between these variables (coefficients of linear correlation, r = 0.638 to 0.874). Calculated values for ergosterol concentration in living fungal biomass present in the soils examined ranged from 5 to 31 mg ergosterol g(-1) living fungal biomass. Data indicate that the wide range in specific ergosterol content of living fungal biomass in soils is related to the total amount of fungal hyphae (living and non-living) in a soil. We propose a method to estimate living fungal biomass from soil ergosterol content which compensates for the variability in fungal ergosterol concentrations by accounting for this relationship. A preliminary evaluation of this approach using independent data from the literature provides support for this method, in that a high correlation (r(2) = 0.999) between predicted and measured living fungal biomass was observed.

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 70: 4748-4755. 	An integrative approach was used to obtain pure cultures of previously uncultivated members of the divisions Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia from agricultural soil and from the guts of wood-feeding termites. Some elements of the cultivation procedure included the following: the use of agar media with little or no added nutrients; relatively long periods of incubation (more than 30 days); protection of cells from exogenous peroxides; and inclusion of humic acids or a humic acid analogue (anthraquinone disulfonate) and quorum-signaling compounds (acyl homoserine lactones) in growth media. The bacteria were incubated in the presence of air and in hypoxic (1 to 2% O-2 [vol/vol]) and anoxic atmospheres. Some bacteria were incubated with elevated concentrations of CO2 (5% [vol/vol]). Significantly more Acidobacteria were found on isolation plates that had been incubated with 5% CO2. A simple, high-throughput, PCR-based surveillance method (plate wash PCR) was developed. This method greatly facilitated detection and ultimate isolation of target bacteria from as many as 1,000 colonies of nontarget microbes growing on the same agar plates. Results illustrate the power of integrating culture methods with molecular techniques to isolate bacteria from phylogenetic groups under-represented in culture. 	1	\N

Geostatistical techniques were used to quantify the scale and degree of soil heterogeneity in 2 m(2) plots around 9-year-old poplar trees and within a wheat field. Samples were taken during two years, on an unaligned grid, for analysis of soil respiration, C and N content, available P, gravimetric moisture, pH, nitrification potential, and root biomass. Kriged maps of soil respiration, moisture, and C content showed strong spatial structure associated with poplar trees but not with wheat rows. All soil properties showed higher autocorrelation in June than in April. Isopleth patchiness for all variates was less in June. This was associated with lower respiration rates due to lower litter decomposition. From the degree and scale of heterogeneity seen in this study, we conclude that the main causes of soil heterogeneity at this scale (2 m(2)) are likely to be found at micro scales controlled in part by plant root and plant residue patterns. These must be understood in the evaluation of ecosystem processes. 	1	\N

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 70: 301-309. 	The effect of standard agricultural management on the genetic heterogeneity of nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) fragments from denitrifying prokaryotes in native and cultivated soil was explored. Thirty-six soil cores were composited from each of the two soil management conditions. nosZ gene fragments were amplified from triplicate samples, and PCR products were cloned and screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RELP). The total nosZ RFLP profiles increased in similarity with soil sample size until triplicate 3-g samples produced visually identical RFLP profiles for each treatment. Large differences in total nosZ profiles were observed between the native and cultivated soils. The fragments representing major groups of clones encountered at least twice and four randomly selected clones with unique RFLP patterns were sequenced to verify nosZ identity. The sequence diversity of nosZ clones from the cultivated field was higher, and only eight patterns were found in clone libraries from both soils among the 182 distinct nosZ RFLP patterns identified from the two soils. A group of clones that comprised 32% of all clones dominated the gene library of native soil, whereas many minor groups were observed in the gene library of cultivated soil. The 95% confidence intervals of the Chao1 nonparametric richness estimator for nosZ RFLP data did not overlap, indicating that the levels of species richness are significantly different in the two soils, the cultivated soil having higher diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences grouped the majority of nosZ clones into an interleaved Michigan soil cluster whose cultured members are alpha-Proteobacteria. Only four nosZ sequences from cultivated soil and one from the native soil were related to sequences found in gamma-Proteobacteria. Sequences from the native field formed a distinct, closely related cluster (D-mean = 0.16) containing 91.6% of the native clones. Clones from the cultivated field were more distantly related to each other (D-mean = 0.26), and 65% were found outside of the cluster from the native soil, further indicating a difference in the two communities. Overall, there appears to be a relationship between use and richness, diversity, and the phylogenetic position of nosZ sequences, indicating that agricultural use of soil caused a shift to a more diverse denitrifying community. 	1	\N

Functional- and abundance-based mechanisms explain diversity loss due to N fertilization. PNAS 102: 4387-4392. 	Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of &gt;900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from &gt;60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As IN availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity. 	1	\N

Measuring the tempospatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is time consuming, expensive, and encounters many uncertainties. This work aimed to develop a new model (REPM, Relative Effective Porosity Model) that estimates Ks from relative effective porosity (phi (er)) and then compare it with a model (EPM, Effective Porosity Model) that estimates it from effective porosity (phi (e)). The effective porosity (phi (e)) is defined as the total porosity minus field capacity (FC), and the relative effective porosity (phi (er)) is defined as effective porosity (phi (e)) divided by FC. Both phi (er) and phi (e) can be estimated from FC and bulk density (B-d). Data from 11 homogeneous textural-class mean soils and several international and American soils were used to evaluate REPM and EPM. For the 11 textural-class mean soils, log (K-s) was highly correlated to log (phi (er)) as well as to log (phi (e)). For the international soils, log (K-s) was highly correlated to log (r(2) = 0.77), but the correlation was less pronounced between log (K-s) and log (phi (e)) (r(2) = 0.58). The saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils from an international database was more accurately predicted by REPM (RMSE of 539 cm d(-1)) than by EPM (RMSE of 733 cm d(-1)), while both of them performed as well for American soils. The slope and the intercept of REPM and the slope of EPM were independent of soil. These results suggest that our new model gives reasonable estimates of K-s for different soils. 	1	\N

Soil Science Society of America Journal 69: 1722-1729. 	Methane oxidation in well-aerated soils is a significant global sink for atmospheric methane. We examined the effects of soil disturbance (simulated tillage) and N-fertilizer additions on methane oxidation in old-growth forest, mid-successional, and no-till maize ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. We found highest oxidation rates in forest sites (about 30 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) on average), with average rates in successional and agricultural sites about 75 and 12% of this, respectively. In the forest and successional sites a one-time N-fertilizer addition (100 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1)) significantly suppressed oxidation for the several weeks that inorganic N pools were elevated. There was no effect of fertilizer addition in the agricultural site, where available N was already high and oxidation rates low. Soil disturbance by itself had no detectable effect on fluxes in any of the sites. Results confirm the overriding importance of elevated N for suppressing CH4 oxidation in managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and suggest further that recovery of CH4 suppression following agriculture is related to slow-changing soil properties such as soil organic matter composition or microbial community structure. 	1	\N

Long-term and large-scale perspectives on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. BioScience 53: 89-98. 	In a growing body of literature from a variety of ecosystems is strong evidence that various components of biodiversity have significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. However, much of this evidence comes from short-term, small-scale experiments in which communities are synthesized from relatively small species pools and conditions are highly controlled. Extrapolation of the results of such experiments to longer time scales and larger spatial scales-those of whole ecosystems-is difficult because the experiments do not incorporate natural processes such as recruitment limitation and colonization of new species. We show how long-term study of planned and accidental changes in species richness and composition suggests that the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning will vary over time and space. More important, we also highlight areas of uncertainty that need to be addressed through coordinated cross-scale and cross-site research. 	1	\N

A method with the combined advantages of soil particle washing, selective inhibitors, and an indicator substrate was developed to isolate saprophytic basidiomycetes from soil. Organic particles were washed from soil and plated on a medium containing lignin, guaiacol, and benomyl, which reduced mold growth and allowed detection of basidiomycetes producing laccase or peroxidase. The 64 soil samples yielded 67 basidiomycete isolates, representing 51 groups on the basis of morphology and physiology, This method should facilitate investigations into the biodiversity of soil basidiomycetes and yield organisms that are useful in bioremediation of soils contaminated with pesticides or other recalcitrant aromatic compounds. 	1	\N

Soil probably harbours most of our planet's undiscovered biodiversity. Recent results from both, culturing and nucleic acid-based approaches indicate that soil microbial diversity is even higher than previously imagined. One reason for the high diversity is that much of the diversity can be found at very small scales. If the same genotypes are not repeated at other locations, the large-scale diversity is greatly multiplied. It remains to be seen to what extent this large genotypic diversity actually affects functional diversity, microbial ecology, or biotechnological significance. Here we present a framework of methods for opening the soil black box that provides different levels of resolution of both microbial community structure and activity. The rationale for and examples of use of three of these methods are presented: guanine plus cytosine content of total soil DNA (G+C), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes amplified from soil DNA, and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of rRNA genes from soil DNA and from isolates. These methods give coarse and moderate scale resolution of the soil community The G+C method, which is one of the few comprehensive coarse scale methods, is also quantitative and can be used to separate DNA into G+C fractions for a second level of composition or activity analysis. The example of the ARDRA method used here illustrates that the same populations of 2,4-D degraders became dominant in three soils of very different land use history and that several of the 2,4-D degrading isolates from these sites had the same ARDRA pattern found from the soil DNA indicating that the isolates represent the dominant populations in the 2,4-D treated soil.

Accurate determination of leaf appearance rate is required in crop simulation models to estimate canopy development and ultimately crop yield. Most crop simulation models use air temperature for thermal time calculations to estimate leaf appearance rate, although the near soil temperature is more closely related to the growing apex temperature than air temperature before stem elongation. A held experiment was conducted in 1996 at East Lansing, MI, to determine the effect of soil, air, and apex temperatures on maize (Zea mays L.) leaf development. Maize leaf tip appearance dates and leaf numbers were observed on four sowing dates to provide variations in the thermal regime of developing plants. Solar irradiance and temperature of the air (1.5 m height), apex, and soil (1-, 3-, and 5-cm depths) were recorded on 0.5-h (half-hourly) intervals. The daily average soil temperature at the 3- to 5-cm depth was reasonably close (+0.6 degreesC in average) to the daily average apex temperature for use as a surrogate for apex temperature to increase the accuracy of maize development simulation in the sowing to ninth leaf tip stage. Thereafter, the air temperature was sufficiently accurate to estimate plant development. Using apex temperatures from leaf 3 to 9, this study indicated that the phyllochron was near 55 degreesC d (degree days) per leaf tip appearance. The consistent bias between air and apex temperature from sowing to V6 found in this study clearly indicates the necessity of using the right temperature in thermal time calculations for accurate maize development simulation. 	1	\N

Freshwater Biology 48: 1329-1352.	1. The Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX) was a coordinated study of the relationships between North American biomes and factors governing ammonium uptake in streams. Our objective was to relate inter-biome variability of ammonium uptake to physical, chemical and biological processes.  2. Data were collected from 11 streams ranging from arctic to tropical and from desert to rainforest. Measurements at each site included physical, hydraulic and chemical characteristics, biological parameters, whole-stream metabolism and ammonium uptake. Ammonium uptake was measured by injection of N-15-ammonium and downstream measurements of N-15-ammonium concentration. 3. We found no general, statistically significant relationships that explained the variability in ammonium uptake among sites. However, this approach does not account for the multiple mechanisms of ammonium uptake in streams. When we estimated biological demand for inorganic nitrogen based on our measurements of in-stream metabolism, we found good correspondence between calculated nitrogen demand and measured assimilative nitrogen uptake. 4. Nitrogen uptake varied little among sites, reflecting metabolic compensation in streams in a variety of distinctly different biomes (autotrophic production is high where allochthonous inputs are relatively low and vice versa).5. Both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism require nitrogen and these biotic processes dominate inorganic nitrogen retention in streams. Factors that affect the relative balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism indirectly control inorganic nitrogen uptake. 	1	\N

Anaerobic microbial processes play particularly important roles in the biogeochemical functions of wetlands, affecting water quality, nutrient transport, and greenhouse gas fluxes. This study simultaneously examined nitrate and sulfate removal rates in sediments of five southwestern Michigan wetlands varying in their predominant water sources from ground water to precipitation. Rates were estimated using in situ push-pull experiments, in which 500 mL of anoxic local ground water containing ambient nitrate and sulfate and amended with bromide was injected into the near-surface sediments and subsequently withdrawn over time. All wetlands rapidly depleted nitrate added at ambient ground water concentrations within 5 to 20 h, with the rate dependent on concentration. Sulfate, which was variably present in porewaters, was also removed from injected ground water in all wetlands, but only after nitrate was depleted. The sulfate removal rate in ground water-fed wetlands was independent of concentration, in contrast to rates in precipitation-fed wetlands. Sulfate production was observed in some sites during the period of nitrate removal, suggesting that the added nitrate either stimulated sulfur oxidation, possibly by bacteria that can utilize nitrate as an oxidant, or inhibited sulfate reduction by stimulating denitrification. All wetland sediments examined were consistently capable of removing nitrate and sulfate at concentrations found in ground water and precipitation inputs, over short time and space scales. These results demonstrate how a remarkably small area of wetland sediment can strongly influence water quality, such as in the cases of narrow riparian zones or small isolated wetlands, which may be excluded from legal protection. 	1	\N

We sampled corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations, corn monocultures, and plant successional experiments in Southwest MI over a 2-year period to study the effects of alternative management practices on microbial biomass and particulate organic matter (POM) C and N in the top 20 or 25 cm of soil. Microbial biomass was measured using the chloroform fumigation, incubation method. POM was defined as the organic C and N content of primary soil particles in the 53-2000 mum size class. Microbial C decreased during a drought in 1994, and was greater in treatments receiving compost rather than inorganic fertilizer in 1995, but was only weakly correlated with N mineralization in aerobic laboratory incubations. Microbial biomass accounted for an average of 2.6% of soil C and 4.9% of soil N in all treatments sampled in 1995. Microbial C:N ratio was lower in July and November (6.0) than in April and September (7.3), and lower in successional treatments without tillage (5.2) than in agronomic treatments (6.7). Changes in microbial N were large enough to affect short term N availability, but tended to be transitory. POM increased after compost additions, and was greater in successional plots without tillage than in tilled treatments, but did not increase immediately after the incorporation of plant residues. POM accounted for 19.7% of C and 14.8% of N in 1995. Its C:N ratio was 20.8 in a never tilled successional treatment and 16.0 in all other soils. The C:N ratio was 17.0 on average in the 250-2000 mum size fraction, compared to 15.5 in the 53-250 mum fraction. There was a strong correlation between POM and N mineralization in 70- and 150-day aerobic incubations, but there was greater N mineralization per unit POM in April and November than in September or October in both years of the study. These results suggest that POM could be used to estimate N mineralization if combined with information about recently deposited plant residues. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. 	1	\N

A simple, rapid method for bacterial lysis and direct extraction of DNA from soils with minimal shearing was developed to address the risk of chimera formation from small template DNA during subsequent PCR, The method was based on lysis with a high-salt extraction buffer (1.5 M NaCl) and extended heating (2 to 3 h) of the soil suspension in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and proteinase K. The extraction method required 6 h and was tested on eight soils differing in organic carbon, clay content, and pH, including ones from which DNA extraction is difficult, The DNA fragment size in crude extracts from all soils was &gt;23 kb. Preliminary trials indicated that DNA recovery from two soils seeded with gram-negative bacteria was 92 to 99%. When the method was tested on all eight unseeded soils, microscopic examination of indigenous bacteria in soil pellets before and after extraction showed variable cell lysis efficiency (26 to 92%). Crude DNA yields from the eight soils ranged from 2.5 to 26.9 mu g of DNA g(-1), and these were positively correlated with the organic carbon content in the soil (r = 0.73), DNA yields from gram-positive bacteria from pure cultures were two to six times higher when the high-salt-SDS-heat method was combined with mortar-and-pestle grinding and freeze-thawing, and most DNA recovered was of high molecular weight, Four methods for purifying crude DNA were also evaluated for percent recovery, fragment size, speed, enzyme restriction, PCR amplification, and DNA-DNA hybridization. In general, all methods produced DNA pure enough for PCR amplification, Since soil type and microbial community characteristics will influence DNA recovery, this study provides guidance for choosing appropriate extraction and purification methods on the basis of experimental goals. 	1	\N

Ph.D. Dissertation,\r\n        Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Arbuscular mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of vascular plants.&nbsp; Part of this dissertation is devoted to analyzing the fatty acid and sterols of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Sorghum with the aim of identifying universal molecular markers of mycorrhizal infection.&nbsp; The mycorrhizal fungi contain high amounts of unusual lipids that may be used to mark their presence in infected roots.&nbsp; My results show that phosopholipid fatty acid 16:1, as well as campesterol are molecules that can be used to consistently identify mycorrhizal infection.&nbsp; In addition, lipid profiles may provide insight as to which fungal species is present in the roots.\nIn a second experiment, the fatty acids and sterols of several isolates of root pathogenic fungi were surveyed to assess the taxonomic value of lipid profiles.&nbsp; My results show that the genera Rhizoctonia and Pythium can be reliably identified because of their characteristic lipid composition.&nbsp; \nAnother question that I address in this work is:&nbsp; What is the C turnover time of mycorrhizal lipids?&nbsp; For this purpose, I carried out a pulse-chase experiment in which I followed the incorporation and subsequent turnover of C in mycorrhizal lipids.&nbsp; Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants were subjected to a pulse exposure to 14CO2followed by sequential harvesting.&nbsp; Infected plants assimilated more 14C than non-mycorrhizal plants, and had a higher absolute and percentage allocation of 14C to root tissue, below ground respiration, and soil.&nbsp; Despite the increased fixation of C by mycorrhizal plants, mycorrhizal shoots had reduced biomass.&nbsp; This indicates that the C drain imposed by the results in a reduced shoot growth, suggesting that the mycorrhizal fungus was acting as a parasite.&nbsp; The pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that the lipids of mycorrhizal roots are a dynamic pool of C with measurable turnover of 14C.&nbsp; The C turnover time of the mycorrhizal fatty acid 16:1 w 5 was calculated at 210 h-1.&nbsp; The lipids of non-mycorrhizal roots incorporated less radiolabel, underscoring the difference in the lipid C cycle between the arbuscular mycorrhizae and non-mycorrhizal roots.&nbsp; To my knowledge, this is the first measurement of the C turnover of a biomass component of the mycorrhizal fungus. 	2	\N

I examined the role of land use history and soil drainage characteristics in influencing the development of a 27 year old-field plant community in southwest Michigan.&nbsp; A divergence in species composition that occurred within the field between 1964 (year of abandonment from agriculture) and 1991 is reflected in the current plant community as a distinct west to east zonation in the abundance of woody vegetation.&nbsp; A similar zonation among the early successional species dominating the field in 1970 indicates that the divergence may be related to the initial colonizing patterns of the dominant perennial grasses (Agropyron repens, Poa compressa, and Poa pratensis), and their differential impact on patterns of woody plant establishment.&nbsp; It appears that an early successional spatial segregation of Agropyron repens and Poa species was not strongly related to variation in soil texture but rather to the effects of pre-abandonment weed control practices.	2	\N

I conducted three manipulative field experiments: 1) to examine the effects of living plant neighbors and accumulated plant litter on the recruitment and growth of target plants across gradients of plant productivity and community biomass, and 2) to examine the impact of nutrient enrichment, increased productivity and litter accumulation on species richness in southwest Michigan old-fields.\nPlant removal experiments conducted at eleven old-field sites showed that the surrounding plant community suppressed the recruitment and growth of three native grass species (Andropogon gerardi, Schizachyrium scoparium, Sorghastrum nutans) across a wide range of productivity.&nbsp; The net suppressive effect of the surrounding plant community on two of the three target species increased in magnitude with community biomass as predicted by biomass-dependent theories of plant competition.&nbsp; Non-linear dependence of net community effects on community biomass indicated that biomass-dependent theories of competition may be most applicable to narrow ranges of low productivity.&nbsp; The degree to which the effects of plant litter contributed to the net effect of the plant community on target plant performance depended on the life history stage examined.&nbsp; Inhibitory litter effects on seedling recruitment increased with community biomass and contributed to the net effect of the community on recruitment at sites of intermediate community biomass, but litter had little impact on established transplants at any of the sites.&nbsp; \nIn a two-year experiment carried out in a grass-dominated old-field, nitrogen enrichment increased living plant and litter biomass and reduced species richness by inhibiting the colonization of forb species.&nbsp; Community responses to litter removal and litter addition treatments that were carried out in conjunction with nitrogen enrichment showed that declines in species richness and forb density were due to effects associated with increases in both living plant and litter biomass.\nThe results highlight the potential importance of effects associated with both living plant biomass and accumulated plant litter in influencing plant recruitment, species diversity, and the distribution of native grasses across old-field productivity gradients.&nbsp; The general significance of these findings are discussed with respect to existing theories of plant community organization.	2	\N

Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan,\r\n    USA.	Nitrite leaching reflects poor nutrient retention, poses a hazard to public health and a challenge to solute transport theory. Field observations and numerical simulation of soil-plant interactions are integrated to identify sensitivity of simulated nitrate leaching to errors in predicted root function. Seasonal changes in maize root distributions, canopy development, and gradients in soil water content and carbon dioxide partial pressures were quantified in 1990 and 1991 during water deficits in a field lysimeter under an irrigated, rain shelter. Seasonal changes in these parameters and in soil mineral and leached N were determined during 1991 in four field lysimeters subjected to conventional or no-till crop culture. Horizontal and vertical gradients in root intersections with 0.05 (I.D.) x 1.4 m polybutyrate tubes corresponded with transient deficits in plant water supply, and subsequent root proliferation during mid-vegetative growth stages. A horizontal complement to the vertical rooting front is characterized by exponential distributions of inter-root distances under a row crop. Geostatistical measures of clustered root distributions indicate spatial correlation up to 0.45 m at anthesis. Failure to consider depth-dependent gradients in root xylem potential most likely accounts for systematic bias in soil water depletion predicted by a simplified solution to a cylindrical model of root water uptake., Soil plus root respiration is related to vertical root distributions, but vertical gradients in C02 and C02 flux fail to satisfy conditions for the steady state assumption. Increased N03-N retention in conventional till soil, relative to no-till soil indicates solute partitioning among mobile and immobile regions of soil water may be modified by historic tillage effects. Deviations in N03-N concentrations of leachate from seasonal trends coincide with extreme high or low drainage flux conditions, invalidating assumptions of homogeneous pore velocities and solute concentrations. Simulated N03-N leaching rates are sensitive to errors in predicted infiltration, canopy dimensions and drainage below the root zone, but are insensitive to reductions in maximum root length density. Managing soil-plant interactions for optimal productivity and solute retention requires accurate simulation of system behaviour when regulation shifts from atmospheric boundary conditions to soil system transport and transformation processes.	2	\N

Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. Ph.D. Dissertation,\r\n    Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.	The effect of long term 2,4-D selection on the microbial community and its impact on nutrient transformation was studied in the field and microcosms.&nbsp; 2,4-D was applied at (0X which is the control), the normal field rate of 1.1 kg/ha (1X), 10X and 100X the normal field rate for ten years.&nbsp; The microbial community was analyzed by cultural methods, reverse sample genome probing (RSGP) and functional gene probing.&nbsp; RSGP showed that the microbial community in the 100X plots had been altered such that there was an enrichment in some 2,4-D degrading populations compared to the control.&nbsp; In such altered microbial communities, microbial biomass, and microbial respiration were reduced.&nbsp; Carbon and nitrogen mineralization were also depressed and the depressive effect lasted for a 30 day incubation.&nbsp; Effect of long term high 2,4-D application did not significantly interfere with nutrient transformation although it did reduce plant productivity which may have contributed to the reduction in soil microbial biomass.\nMicrocosm studied demonstrated that management history of the soil (40 years plant succession, 10 years no-till, conventional agriculture) did not influence which 2,4-D degraders be3came dominant members in the 2,4-D amended soil.&nbsp; Dominance by Burkholderia sp. was seen in the microcosm studies whilst in the field studies Burkholderia and its close relative Ralstonia sp. were dominant providing evidence of niche partitioning of 2,4-D degrading bacteria in the field.&nbsp; Discontinuing 2,4-D treatment in the southern part of the plots for three years resulted in a decrease in culturable and RSGP detectable population of 2,4-D degrading bacteria although 2,4-d enriched populations were still above control levels three years after 2,4-D added had been suspended.&nbsp; Hence it appears to take many years for perturbed populations to return to their normal densities once the perturbation is removed.	2	\N

Crop and Soil Sciences.\r\n        Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan,\r\n        USA.	Nitrification, the microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate, leads to significant nitrogen (N) losses from soils.&nbsp; Nitrification rates in soils have been related to population sizes of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, but population structure effects are poorly understood.&nbsp; This study employed nucleic acid-based methods to determine how ammonia oxidizer populations differed in cultivated, never-tilled, and successional soils.&nbsp; Hybridizations were conducted between genomic DNA from pure cultures and probes from Nitrosomonas europaea genes for ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxidireductase.&nbsp; These probes produced 24 to 80% less hybridization signal in genomic DNA from four other ammonia oxidizers under low-stringency conditions.&nbsp; This indicated that N. europaea functional probes would not provide quantitative size estimates for heterogeneous populations.&nbsp; Sizes of ammonia oxidizer populations in soils were determined by Most Probable Number (MPN) enumeration in media containing 10, 100, or 2000 ppm NH4-N.&nbsp; MPN counts were consistently one-tenth lower in never-tilled soils than in cultivated soils.&nbsp; Population structures were compared by using PCR to amplify 16S rRNA genes of ammonia oxidizers from bacterial community DNA, cloning the PCR products, and comparing cloned sequences for percent similarity over a 318-base region.&nbsp; The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from never-tilled soils were four times more diverse than sequences obtained from cultivated soils.&nbsp;&nbsp; A phylogenetic tree showed that sequences from cultivated soils fell within one distinct cluster of Nitrosospira; sequences from never-tilled soils fell into two clusters of Nitrosospira and one of Nitrosomonas.&nbsp; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns differed between samples from never-tilled and cultivated soils; patterns from samples from replicate plots of each treatment were very similar in each of two successive years.&nbsp; Probe hybridizations of DGGE blots showed that sequences from the single subgroup of Nitrosospira spp. predominated in samples from cultivated or fertilized successional soils; these were not detected in samples from never-tilled or unfertilized successional soils.&nbsp; Differences in populations were reflected in mean NH4-N concentrations that were tenfold higher in never-tilled soils that in cultivated soils.&nbsp; Different influential factors in these soils include pH, allelopathy, microsite distribution, or direct effects of cultivation and fertilization.	2	\N

Patterns of tree recruitment, soil moisture, potential N mineralization, and light availability were examined for twelve plantations and three oak-hickory forests on similar upland soils in southwestern Michigan.&nbsp; Levels of all resources varied significantly across stands.&nbsp; Stands dominated by hardwoods were highest in soil resources, while red pine and Douglas-fir stands were lowest.&nbsp; Percent light was lowest beneath white pine stands and highest under red pine and scots pine stands.&nbsp; Principal components analysis produced a stand ordination reflecting a contrast between soil resources and light.&nbsp; The most abundant seedling and sapling species were red maple and black cherry, while oaks and several mesic-site species were sparsely represented.&nbsp; Red maple and black cherry showed no relationship to stand type or resource gradients, and were not dispersal-limited.&nbsp; These two species, by exhibiting wide tolerances for resources and aggressive colonization and dispersal, are likely to dominant those plantations allowed to senesce undisturbed.	2	\N

Crop &amp; Soil Sciences.\r\n        Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan,\r\n        USA.	The influence of biodiversity on ecosystem processes has been the subject of considerable research effort and debate among plant and animal ecologists but the ecosystem consequences of microbial diversity are largely unknown.&nbsp; I tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production.&nbsp; I used a soil enzyme assay to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O.&nbsp; By controlling, or providing in non-limiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, I created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production in soils from two fields in southwest Michigan was denitrifier community composition.&nbsp; I found that the denitrification enzymes of the denitrifying communities&nbsp; from the two fields differed substantially in their sensitivities to oxygen and pH, indicating that the denitrifying communities in these two soils respond to environmental regulators differently.\nI also isolated denitrifying bacteria from these same soil samples and, for 31 representative isolates, measured the sensitivity of their nos enzymes, which catalyze the reduction of N2O to N2, to low levels of oxygen.&nbsp; Cluster analysis of the cellular fatty acid profiles of 93 denitrifying bacteria isolated from the agricultural field and 63 from the successional field showed 27 denitrifying taxa with only 12 common to both soils.&nbsp; In addition, I found substantial diversity in the degree of sensitivity of the isolates' nos enzymes to oxygen, indicating that the taxonomic diversity present among denitrifiers in these two soils is functionally significant.&nbsp; These results demonstrate a clear potential for differences in denitrifier community composition to affect differences in N2O production among ecosystems, independent of direct environmental controls.\nI also investigated the spatial distribution of microbial community structure along a transect in a conventionally-tilled agricultural field.&nbsp; I used fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile analysis, a rapid technique that allows processing of the large number of samples required for spatial analyses of microbial community structure,&nbsp; I applied principal components analysis to these data and showed that, while a majority of 167 soil samples had similar FAME profiles, about 20 percent of samples had relatively low and about 10 percent had relatively high bacterial:fungal ratios.&nbsp; Using semivariance analysis I was able to capture and describe small-scale patterns of microbial population distributions.&nbsp; Where autocorrelation occurred, it was generally at scakes &lt; 0.2 m, a scale analogous to individual soil peds and rhizospheres.	2	\N

Dept.\r\n        of Botany and Plant Pathology. Michigan State University, East Lansing,\r\n        Michigan, USA.	Many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain coexistence among plant species.&nbsp; Spatial heterogeneity in soil resources at scales smaller than individual plants may promote coexistence by forcing a trade-off between the efficient locating of nutrient patches (scale foraging) and the efficient exploiting of nutrient patches (precision foraging).&nbsp; Evidence from Campbell et al. (1991) suggests that dominant species use a scale foraging strategy whereas subordinate species use a precision foraging strategy.\nTo test whether dominant and subordinate species differed in foraging strategy under heterogeneous soil resource conditions, I conducted a series of greenhouse experiments in which I varied patch size and intensity, using two dominant (Bromus inermis and Solidago canadensis) and three subordinate (Achillea millefolium, Rumex acetosella, and Silene latifolia) herbaceous perennial species commonly found in local old fields.&nbsp; One of the dominant species (Bromus) consistently had high tissue nitrogen content, but had lower nitrogen contents as patch size and nutrient intensity decreased.&nbsp; This performance pattern was consistent with that expected for a scale forager.&nbsp; the other dominant species (Solidago) and the three subordinate species had lower nitrogen contents overall, but more consistent nitrogen contents across patch sizes and nutrient intensities.&nbsp; This performance pattern was consistent with that expected for a precision forager.&nbsp; There appeared to be a trade-off between the ability to acquire a large amount of nitrogen and the ability to maintain constant acquisition levels in the plant as nutrient patch sizes changed.\nI also predicted that precision and scale-foraging species would differ in the mechanisms they used to respond to nutrient heterogeneity.&nbsp; Although I found differences among species with respect to which response mechanisms they used, the differences were not related to precision vs. scale foraging strategies.&nbsp; Two of the four precision-foraging species, Achillea and Solidago, ubcreased their branching density in nutrient patches.&nbsp; All species were able to selectively allocate root biomass to nutrient enriched pot quadrants.&nbsp; None of these species changed root system topology in response to nutrient patches.&nbsp; Rumex and Silene, two of the precision-foraging species, adjusted nitrogen uptake so that root nitrogen concentrations were constant across patch sizes.&nbsp; Bromus (a scale forager), Achillea and Solidago (precision foragers) adjusted nitrogen uptake so that root concentrations in enriched pot quadrants were higher than in background quadrants.&nbsp; These five species did not differ in the patch size or nutrient intensity at which they used a response mechanism.\nTo fully understand the role that nutrient heterogeneity may play in determining plant community structure, we must also know the size, intensity and frequency of small scale patches in the environment.&nbsp; Spatial sampling and geostatistical analysis techniques are useful tools for quantifying spatial variation of nutrients in the field, but it is unclear what spatial sampling pattern will be most sensitive to multiple scales of heterogeneity.&nbsp; Using computer simulated data and semivariance analysis, I determined that a stratified-nested grid sampling regime would be more sensitive than a random or stratified grid sampling regime when determining the magnitude and scale of environmental heterogeneity across several sites.	2	\N
218	Daroub, S. 1994. The effect of tillage on phosphorus\r\n    transformations in soils. Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing,\r\n    Michigan, USA.	Conservation tillage is becoming more widely accepted as an alternative tillage system in crop production. Organic matter and microbial activity may increase with no-tillage (NT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). Accumulation of organic matter and phosphorus (P) near the surface of soil occurs in NT soils which may affect the distribution of P pools in soils. The effect of NT and CT on soil P fractions was investigated, and the turnover rates of 33P added in soybean residues to soils from three experimental sites in Michigan was determined. The role of microorganisms in the turnover of 33P added in residues was also studied in a never tilled soil. The effect of microorganisms was separated by sterilizing the soil with gamma irradiation before adding the residues. Phosphorus transformations were compared in the sterilized and non-sterilized soil.\nSoybean plants labeled with 33P were added to soils, incubated at field capacity, extracted periodically (0, 6, 12, 18, 26, and 34 days), and P analyzed in the different P fractions. The fractions extracted were resin, NaHC03, microbial biomass, NaOH, NaOH after sonication, HCI, and residue P fractions.\nWith NT inorganic P accumulated in the calcareous soil which received P fertilizers. NaOH extractable organic P (Po) concentrations were higher in the NT treatments in the two non-calcareous soils. There was no effect of tillage on the labile Po pool.\nThe largest fraction of the applied 33P was found in the inorganic labile form. This fraction decreased with time with an increase in the NaOH fraction in all three soils. An increase in the HC1 fraction occurred in the calcareous soil. Phosphorus cycling through the microbial pool was evident before more of the 33P ended up in the NaOH fraction. The effect of tillage on the 33P turnover was minimal in all the P fractions extracted including the microbial fraction.\nTwenty percent of the 33P was found in the microbial pool at day 12 in the nonsterilized never tilled soil. About 6% to 11% of the 33P found in the NaOH fraction is suspected to be organic and have cycled through the microbial pool.	2	\N

Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State\r\n        University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Managing nitrogen (N) for maximum crop use efficiency and minimum environmental impact in agricultural systems that use organic versus fertilizer N inputs requires more information on N cycling in these systems.&nbsp; The overall objective of this research was to compare N cycling in animal-, legume-, and fertilizer-based cropping systems with an emphasis on evaluating each system for its potential to lose N to the environment.&nbsp; Specific objectives were 1) to trace the fate of red clover (trifolium pratense L.) and ammonium sulphate 15N into crops plus soil, and calculate loss by subtraction, 2) measure the soil N supplying capacity using long-term laboratory incubations, 3) measure NO3-N leaching using lysimeters, and 4) measure the effect of mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) on recovery of legume and fertilizer 15N by corn using a modified 15N method.\n15N-labeled red clover and ammonium sulphate were applied to microplots in the long-term Rodale farming systems trial located in east central Pennsylvania in 1987 and 1988 and traced into first-year corn (Zea mays L.), second-year barley (Hordeum distichum L.) and soil after each crop.&nbsp; Over a 2-y period, more fertilizer N was contributed to crops (40 vs. 17% of input), more legume N was contributed to soil (47 vs. 17% of input) and a similar amount of N from both sources was lost from the cropping systems (39% of input).\nLong-term (200 + d), aerobic, incubations of soil sampled from the Rodale farming systems in 1988 showed that the N supplying capacity of the animal-based cropping system was greater than the legume- and fertilizer-based systems which were similar.&nbsp; A double exponential model was used to estimate the size of the active fraction of soil organic matter N, which was greater in the animal-than legume-based system, which in turn was greater than in the fertilizer-based system.\nNitrate leaching from the animal-, legume-, and fertilizer-based cropping systems at Rodale was measured over a 2-y period starting in Fall 1990 using 0.76 m dia. by 1.0 m deep intact, natural drainage lysimeters.&nbsp; Most NO3-N leached was derived from soil organic matter and not from the applied legume and fertilizer N sources as determined using 15N.\n15N-labeled fertilizer and legume plant material were applied to unlabeled soil, and vice versa, infield microplots at two locations in Michigan in 1991.&nbsp; It was determined that MIT had not effect on recovery of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), red clover, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), or ammonium sulphate 15N by corn.	2	\N

Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State\r\n        University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	I conducted species removal and resource addition experiments in a first- and second-year old-field in southwestern Michigan to test two mechanistic hypotheses about the relationship between diversity and productivity: 1) plant diversity declines with increasing fertility due to increasing competition intensity from the dominant species, and 2) the time of resource addition within a season influences the magnitude of competition intensity, and consequently the effect of a dominant species on community structure.\nIn the first-year annual old-field the effect of the dominant species, Chenopodium album, on subordinate community biomass, evenness, diversity, and nitrogen acquisition depended on the time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; When nitrogen was added early in the growing season (early July) both the dominant species and the subordinate community increases in biomass and total nitrogen content relative to the unfertilized control.&nbsp; However, when nitrogen was added mid- or late-season, the dominant species pre-empted the added nitrogen and exhibited a disproportionate increase in biomass relative to the subordinate community.&nbsp; The subordinate plant community had increased tissue nitrogen concentrations but did not increase in biomass.&nbsp; The degree of canopy development appears to determine the ability of dominant and subordinate species to acquire added nutrients and allocate them to increased growth rather than storage, and thus, influences the magnitude of the effect of the dominant species on diversity and community structure.\nIn the second-year old-field community the composition and abundance of species in the subordinate community varied seasonally, while Conyze canadensis was the clear biomass dominant.&nbsp; Biomass evenness and diversity but not richness declined with increasing C. canadensis biomass.&nbsp; Nitrogen addition reduced evenness and diversity but not richness, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary with the time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; Rather the biomass of life-history/growth form groups and individual species varied with time of nitrogen addition.&nbsp; Light penetration was lower and nitrogen availability was higher in nitrogen addition plots early and mid-season, but by mid-August, resources declined to the same low level in control and nitrogen addition plots.\nFinally, I present a general graphical and statistical approach to evaluate the absolute and relative response of a species biomass hierarchy to experimental treatments or environmental perturbations.	2	\N

Thesis,\r\n    Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	The concentration and d15N of nitrate in groundwater samples collected from two mid-Michigan lysimeters beneath farmland were determined on a weekly basis from March to November of 1993. The soil within one of the lysimeters was tilled and the other was not tilled. Nitrate concentrations in the samples from the tilled lysimeter were approximately twice those of the untilled lysimeter throughout the study. The nitrogen stable isotopic abundances varied similarly on a seasonal basis in the tilled and untilled lysimeters. The d15N values ranged between -3.9 0/00 in the spring to 9.4 0/00 in fall (September). An increasing trend in the d15N of nitrate from both lysimeters occurred from spring to late summer, that was likely the result of fractionation due to denitrification and mineralization of the less readily mineralizable organic fraction. A decrease in d15N was observed from the middle of September to a early November that reflected a decrease in the influence of microbial denitrification on the isotopic composition of nitrate.	2	\N

Ph.D.\r\n        Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Sustainable nitrogen-conservative agroecosystems are increasingly sought by agronomists and environmentalists. This study was designed to evaluate the global hypothesis that temporal continuity of root systems within the soil profile diminishes nitrate leaching and builds easily mineralizable nitrogen pools within root-zone soils. Effects of alfalfa root systems on soil physical properties, soil nitrogen leaching and corn nutrition were investigated in two separate experiments conducted on Kalamazoo loam soils (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) in southwestern Michigan from 1994 to 1996. In the first field experiment, soil nitrogen dynamics were compared under alfalfa and bare fallow. The second field experiment was conducted in conventional and no tillage plots under corn - alfalfa rotation equipped with undisturbed, in situ, large monolith lysimeters. Measurements in this study included: 1) soluble soil mineral nitrogen from suction lysimeters, and fixed soil mineral nitrogen from soil core extractions, 2) volumetric soil water contents by time domain reflectometry, 3) root biomass extracted from deep probe samples, 4) root demographics by minirhizotron technologies, 5) soil physical measurements, and 6) plant biomass and yields. The presence of alfalfa root systems significantly increased saturated hydraulic conductivity, total, and macro-porosities of soils compared to bare fallow. Living alfalfa root systems efficiently prevented nitrate leaching throughout the year, by generally keeping soil solutions below 1 mg L-1  of NO3-N. Second year alfalfa stands accumulated 26 and 76 kg N ha-1  in the crowns and roots respectively. Decomposing alfalfa shoots had little impact on soil nitrate contents compared to root systems, but promoted greater nitrate leaching and denitrification rates. Mineral nitrogen released from spring spray-killed alfalfa and associated soil mineralization was estimated at 115 kg N ha-1  in late November 1996. All nitrogen fertilizer applied to corn, planted directly after spray-killed alfalfa, remained in the soil as mineral nitrogen which was vulnerable to spring leaching. Corn root densities per soil horizon, planted after alfalfa, mimicked alfalfa root demographics. An excess of 40% of the corn roots recolonized alfalfa root induced macropores.	2	\N
225	Rosek, M. 1994. Spatial and temporal soil water content\r\n    changes within a sloping landscape. Ph.D. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East\r\n    Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Soil physical properties and the amount of soil water within a sloping landscape are largely determined by landscape position. This study determined temporal dynamics of soil water within a sloping landscape by (1) examining the spatial variability of selected soil properties that regulate water retention; (2) quantifying water balance by slope position; (3) determining the minimum amount of stored soil water data required to estimate the amount of soil water within a sloping landscape using geostatistics. Neutron probe access tubes were placed at two meter intervals, in two transects, across a sloping topography of Kalamazoo loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic, Typic Hapludalfs) and Oshtemo sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed mesic, Typic Hapludalfs) at Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Michigan. Volumetric water content of the soil was monitored approximately weekly in the spring, summer and autumn of 1990 and 1991 at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm by neutron attenuation. Soil samples from a 48 by 34 meter grid between the access tubes were described and sampled. Water content of each sample point was estimated with CERES Maize for two sample dates. Selected volumetric water per 150 cm soil depth values were removed from the data sets, then kriged and cokriged for mm soil water at locations where data points were removed. The Ap horizon of the lower backslope, footslope, and toeslope display a greater mean thickness, percent silt and organic carbon, relative to upslope soils. The Bt l horizon and control-section display a greater mean silt and clay below the middle of the backslope. The amount of soil water was least within the upper backslope position, moderate within the summit and lower backslope positions, and greatest within the footslope and toeslope positions. Cokriging estimation of stored soil water, using mm soil water per 150 cm soil depth at field capacity as the auxiliary variable, reduced the required sample distance to twice the range of spatial dependence in the direction parallel to the contour of the slope. Variogram models of the amount of soil water from large data sets could be used to predict the amount of soil water in other studies with similar landscape and soil conditions.	2	\N

Coleoptera: Coccinellidae in alfalfa. M.Sc. Thesis,\r\n    Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Yellow sticky traps and quadrat observations or hand collected samples were used to examine the temporal and spatial distribution, and sex ratio of Coccinella septempunctata L. (C7) summer adults. C7 was univoltine, with activity starting in March, eggs and larvae produced in May and early June, and summer adults emerging in mid-June. Emigration to hibernation sites most likely occurred during late July and August. None of the weather factors measured were consistently associated with C7 activity. C7 showed a clumped spatial distribution in traps which was probably due to the attractiveness of traps. A random distribution in quadrats was accepted because there is no biological reason for interaction between individuals during summer. Sex ratio of hand-collected beetles was 1:1. A slight change in sex ratio in traps occurred during late summer. Males were captured on traps more often at the end of July and early August, and more females were captured later.	2	\N

Ph.D.\r\n        Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.	Integrated cropping systems use biological resources such as organic fertilizers, nitrogen fixing plants, and crop and cover crop residues to reduce the need for chemical inputs and improve sustainability. This research explores the effect of integrated management on nitrogen mineralization in a variety of corn-based agricultural rotations and early successional treatments at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) in Southwestern MI. Part 1 defines the effect of management on the seasonal dynamics of nitrogen mineralization potential (NMP), the intrinsic ability of a soil to mineralize N over time (ideally a growing season). Measurements of NMP, based on the accumulation of inorganic N in soils incubated under aerobic conditions for 10, 30, 70, 150 and 310 days at 25 C, are evaluated using 1st order mineralization kinetics and repeated measures analysis of variance. Nitrogen mineralization potential was greatest in the spring and lowest in the fall in all treatments. It increased in response to compost additions, was greater in low-input rotations with cover crops than in conventional rotations, and was greater in successional treatments without tillage than in tilled succession or agronomic treatments. During a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation, NMP was lowest under 2nd year corn and highest under wheat and 1st year corn, reflecting both legume inputs and the lack of spring tillage in wheat. Part 2 of the research found that macroorganic matter was correlated with NMP in most treatments, but that microbial biomass was not. The strongest correlation (r2=.41) was between macroorganic C in the 53-2000 m m size class and inorganic N accumulation in 150 day incubations. Macroorganic matter increased more rapidly after compost additions than NMP, but was less affected by residue inputs. Part 3 of the research found that conventional fertilization produced higher corn and wheat yields and greater leaching loss than additions of leaf and dairy compost. Net annual N mineralization (calculated from plant uptake and leaching loss) was greater in the compost treatments, but N availability was low because of lower than expected compost mineralization (9% yr-1). Nitrogen mineralization was greatest in years with corn production and lowest in years with soybean and wheat production, reflecting (in part) differences in residue input from the previous crop. Much of the variation in N mineralization could be predicted by laboratory measurements of NMP and macroorganic matter, particularly total macroorganic N (53  2000 m m), potentially mineralizable organic matter (No), and N mineralization predicted in 70 and 150 day incubations based on the 1st order kinetics. Leaching loss (October through September) was best predicted by initial inorganic N and total inorganic N (initial plus mineralized) in incubations performed after sidedress fertilization in the preceding season. This research shows that N mineralization varies appreciably within and between growing seasons, and responds predictably to integrated agricultural management.	2	\N
