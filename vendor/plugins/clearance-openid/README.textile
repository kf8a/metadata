h1. Clearance OpenID

p. Added OpenID functionality to Clearance. 

h2. Requirements

.The Clearance engine
.OpenId Authentication Plugin

h2. Installation

Add the plugin:

<pre>
<code>
./script/plugin install git://github.com/srdperu/clearance-openid.git
</code>
</pre>

Run the generate file to create migrations and add the include statements to your Controller and Model files:

<pre>
<code>
./script/generate clearance_openid
</code>
</pre>

Run your new migration files:

<pre>
<code>
rake db:migrate
</code>
</pre>

You are done!

h2. How does it works?

p. It will add  a new admin column to the User table and new module functionality for filtering users, adding barriers for non-users and non-admins.

p. If you don't use the generator, be sure to add 

<pre>
<code>
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Clearance::Admin
</code>
</pre>

and 

<pre>
<code>
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    include Clearance::Admin::User
</code>
</pre>

p. You can then restrict access to your controllers like: 

<pre>
<code>
  class ProjectsController < ApplicationController

    before_filter :admin_only
    
  end</code>
</pre>

p. Or even restrict access to non-admin or non-logged users like:

<pre>
<code>
  class ProjectsController < ApplicationController

    before_filter :user_only
    
  end</code>
</pre>
