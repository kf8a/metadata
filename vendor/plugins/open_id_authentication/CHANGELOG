* Added normalize_url and applied it to all operations going through the plugin [DHH]

* Removed open_id? as the idea of using the same input box for both OpenID and username has died -- use using_open_id? instead (which checks for the presence of params[:openid_url] by default) [DHH]

* Added OpenIdAuthentication::Result to make it easier to deal with default situations where you don't care to do something particular for each error state [DHH]

* Stop relying on root_url being defined, we can just grab the current url instead [DHH]
